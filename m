Correct.  omap-serial used to have broken DMA support, and I had a
series of patches fixing it.  Unfortunately, despite TI asking me to
work on this, TI went ahead and removed the DMA support behind my
back, which totally screwed my patch series after I merged some of
its pre-requists.  It was then decided that DMA support was no longer
an important feature, so I dropped the patch set.

So, I'm well aware of the issues here, and the problems of using the
OMAP sDMA with the UARTs.
