This seems incredibly convoluted and complicated as well as asking for
races and weirdness with the divisibility between the schedule_work and
the atomic operation.

If the only cases are:

	tty->low_latency = 0
				call flush_work
	tty->low_latency = 1
				don't call

	tty->low_latency changes
				call flush_work

then surely the right fix is

	if (tty->low_latency == 0)
		flush_work(&tty->buf.work);

and making the couple of spots we set/unset low latency on a running port
somewhat smarter ?

That avoids an expensive atomic operation as well (and atomic ops are
very expensive on some platforms).
