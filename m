The flag in question is used to ensure that the clock to OCMC RAM is not
disabled by the PM code.

>From the changelog which added this flag:

"Note: OCMC RAM is part of the PER power domain and supports
 retention. The assembly code for low power entry/exit will
 run from OCMC RAM. To ensure that the OMAP PM code does not
 attempt to disable the clock to OCMC RAM as part of the
 suspend process add the no_idle_on_suspend flag."

We had discussed about the usage of this flag in the RFC version
of the patch [1].
