No, please! No extra flag could safe us if people are not able
to set loglevel correctly. Also the importance depends on the
situation. Any message is as important as it helps to resolve
the problem.

This means that any critical message is always more important than any
workload. It opens doors for iteresting DOS attacks.

I agree that direct output is more reliable. It might be very useful
for debugging some types of problems. The question is
if it is worth the cost (code complexity, serializing CPUs
== slowing down the entire system).

But it is is possible that a reasonable offloading (in the direction
of last Sergey's approach) might be a better deal.


I suggest the following way forward (separate patchsets):

    1. Replace log buffer (least controversial thing)
    2. Reliable offload to kthread (would be useful anyway)
    3. Atomic consoles (a lot of tricky code, might not be
		worth the effort)

Could we agree on this?

Best Regards,
Petr
