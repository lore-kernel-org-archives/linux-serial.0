The point is that if you want tty_insert_flip_string() to be called after=
=20
every character is received, there seems little point in using RX DMA. =20
It should be less efficient than PIO.  And the current way that it is used=
=20
is pointless from a power management point of view.

In general, RX DMA would seem to be inappropriate for a latency-sensitive=
=20
application, unless the application can somehow communicate how many bytes=
=20
it's expecting so the driver can adjust its DMA transfer size.
