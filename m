I know my team at Google has an internal patch for exactly that.  FTDI
expanders are complicated as they can be used as UART, GPIO, I2C, SPI
depending on configuration.  Our project was using a mix of I2C and
GPIO so I directly my team to approach it as an MFD.  I'd like to see
all of these use cases handled by the kernel but I understand the
other viewpoint of relying on libusb for cross-platform compatiblity.

If they show up at Linux Plumbers or visit San Jose, I'll take them to
dinner.  I didn't see any docs for the chardev in Documentation.  I
_think_ I understand how it works from reading the relevant sections
of gpiolib.c but I can see how users end up using sysfs instead.

Agreed that that helps with user-space GPIO-based JTAG
implementations.  The problem this patch series is trying to address
is for SoCs like the Aspeed AST2400/2500 that include a hardware
accelerated JTAG master.  It _can_ be run in a pure-software mode
where it acts like GPIOs but the intended use case is to operate an
interrupt-driven state machine.  That requires a higher-level
abstraction for managing the standard JTAG state machine.  Similar to
GPIO .set_multiple, user-space feeding a JTAG kernel API a buffer of
JTAG state changes would be useful.  That's how I recall OpenOCD's
internals working: run short (1-7?) state change sequences to move to
the next decision point.  I know of at least one vendor pushing for
the use of JTAG on BMCs as a way to debug host processors in large
deployments instead of using dongles.  I'm supportive of the adding a
JTAG driver abstraction.  I haven't reviewed this patch series in
detail yet.
