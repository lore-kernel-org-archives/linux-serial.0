It sure would be nice to provide at least some automated handling
for those too, even if it was just to deal with if device_may_wake()
irq_set_irq_wake().

At least in the cases I've seen, the IO interrupt is capable of waking
up too, but not from any deeper idle states. The wakeirq is always
capable of waking up the system, so if wakeirq was configured we
could just ignore the wake configureation for the IO interrupt.

And it seems some devices have a single wakeirq dealing with a group
of IO interrupts (GPIOs), see commit 97d86e07b716 ("Input: gpio_keys -
allow separating gpio and irq in device tree"). Not sure if that
interrupt is wake-up capable, but that would certainly make sense
considering it's for gpio-keys.

So it seems as long as we have one wakeirq entry per device, we
should be covered, even if a single wakeirq needs to wake up multiple
devices.

OK

Are you thinking we could do more than automate irq_set_irq_wake()
for the devices with just wake-up capable IO IRQ?

Sure, at least for the irq_set_irq_wake() case.
