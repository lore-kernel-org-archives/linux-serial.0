Put it this way: pm_runtime_resume invokes a ->runtime_resume
callback routine (the subsystem's or the driver's or whichever), and it
assumes that if the routine returns 0 then the device has been resumed.  
It doesn't really _wait_ for anything; it just calls the callback
routine.

It behaves this way whether or not the irq_safe flag is set.  The only
difference is that if irq_safe is set then the callback routine is
invoked with interrupts disabled (and in this case pm_runtime_resume
may be called in interrupt context -- normally it can be called only in
process context).
