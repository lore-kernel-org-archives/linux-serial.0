I wonder if we have several CPU doing the checksum verification.
New sync printk mechanism has a Big-Konsole-spin-Lock, all CPUs that
want to printk() should line up and wait, in whatever context they
currently are.

If the serial console is a really slow one and we have a CPU in atomic
context spinnig on prb_lock, while the prb_lock is always acquired by
other CPUs, then it may look like a lock-up scenario.
