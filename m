Hope your are trying to use Kevins Wip-UART branch.
Since platform data support is currently available in that branch.

If your are using kevins wip-uart branch then,
ensure you have selected omap-serial driver

Symbol: SERIAL_OMAP [=3Dy]
  =E2=94=82 Prompt: OMAP serial port support
  =E2=94=82   Defined at drivers/serial/Kconfig:1383
  =E2=94=82   Depends on: HAS_IOMEM [=3Dy] && (ARCH_OMAP2 [=3Dy] || ARC=
H_OMAP3
[=3Dy] || ARCH_OMAP4 [=3Dy])
  =E2=94=82   Location:
  =E2=94=82     -> Device Drivers
  =E2=94=82       -> Character devices
  =E2=94=82         -> Serial drivers
  =E2=94=82   Selects: SERIAL_CORE [=3Dy]


Also ensure /etc/inittab is update with ttyO* for console usage.
Update console bootparam accordingly based on UART used.

=46or ex: if uart3 is used as console use console=3DttyO2.
