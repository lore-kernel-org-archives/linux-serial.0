based on Thomas's feedback we should probably not carry forward
wakeirq as a seperate irq with it's own request_irq instead it psuedo
triggers uart's interrupt irq -> I am not clear about the direction
Tony wants drivers to take in the approach in the thread above - all I
wondered was if it had any conflict of pin_sleep -> if the generic
handler retriggers the irq before the suspend_handler, then
configuring sleep is gonna break daisychain support. not sure if there
is any specific direction drivers should take.

Again, Tony is the right guy to comment about this.
