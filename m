Thanks for clarifying. On AM335x, one of the UARTs is in a wakeup domai=
n
and swakeup from this is used to come out of suspend.

I have basic suspend-resume working on it. Strangely this works irrespe=
ctive
of the value of tty_dev wakeup entry. Do you know if this is expected o=
n OMAP?

The other issue concerning runtime PM is that as soon as I set a non-ze=
ro to
the autosuspend_delay_ms I get some garbage characters and eventually t=
he
console stops responding.

[root@arago /]# cat .../omap_uart.0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms
-1
[root@arago /]# echo 3000 > =D6KW=EB=E9=AB+=D7=E9=AB+wU.=C9=D1=B9,z,=BD=
=DD.=C9=BDosuspend_delay=D5=A3=BD=CD=D5=CD...
[root@arago /]#	<- No response after some time

The comment in the code mentions delay is receiving characters if runti=
me PM
is enabled. Any idea what's going wrong at my end?

Regards,
Vaibhav B.
