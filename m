Mmm not sure really...the point is that now the **host parameter is
used both as a flag and also in of_translate_ioport...the problem
that I see is where we set the "host" parameter...I have a proposal
below...

Sorry! I'll take care of this in the future...

Yes I see your point please consider the patch at the bottom...

This comes without saying...the patch I proposed here already applied on
top of your changes and, in fact, you can see that I set 
"*host = of_node_get(parent);" above in my patch to be used by 
of_translate_ioport()

Below I have reworked my patch (that still applies on top of your one) to
make it not ISA specific.
Notice that of_translate_ioport() still stands and that in addr_is_indirect_io()
we make sure the bus address to be in the bus address range that the special
host operates on...
