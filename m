I didn't connect the dots that well. Thank you.

=E2=80=A6

I updated the comment to:

/*=20
 * We do not allow DMA_MEM_TO_DEV transfers to be paused.
 * From the AM572x TRM, 16.1.4.18 Disabling a Channel During Transfer:
 * "When a channel is disabled during a transfer, the channel undergoes
 * an abort, unless it is hardware-source-synchronized =E2=80=A6".
 * A source-synchronised channel is one where the fetching of data is
 * under control of the device. In other words, a device-to-memory
 * transfer. So, a destination-synchronised channel (which would be a
 * memory-to-device transfer) undergoes an abort if the the CCR_ENABLE
 * bit is cleared.
 * From 16.1.4.20.4.6.2 Abort: "If an abort trigger occurs, the channel
 * aborts immediately after completion of current read/write
 * transactions and then the FIFO is cleaned up." The term "cleaned up"
 * is not defined. TI recommends to check that RD_ACTIVE and WR_ACTIVE
 * are both clear _before_ disabling the channel, otherwise data loss
 * will occur.
 * The problem is that if the channel is active, then device activity
 * can result in DMA activity starting between reading those as both
 * clear and the write to DMA_CCR to clear the enable bit hitting the
 * hardware. If the DMA hardware can't drain the data in its FIFO to th=
e
 * destination, then data loss "might" occur (say if we write to an UAR=
T
 * and the UART is not accepting any further data).

would that be okay?

If I google for it, I find it. pause/resume support for cyclic was adde=
d
later without a note why it is only supported for cyclic.
