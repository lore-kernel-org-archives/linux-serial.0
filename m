Where should we get the range from? For LPC we know that it is going
Work on anything that is not used by PCI I/O space, and this is 
why we use [0, PCIBIOS_MIN_IO]

These accessors do not operate on IO tokens:

If (arm64_extio_ops->start > addr || arm64_extio_ops->end < addr)
addr is not going to be an I/O token; in fact patch 2/3 imposes that
the I/O tokens will start at PCIBIOS_MIN_IO. So from 0 to PCIBIOS_MIN_IO
we have free physical addresses that the accessors can operate on.
