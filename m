Doing this masks the problem.  If you do 1 without 2, you'll see that
UART4 can never go idle.

Please test without this change and use the sysfs files to enable the
timeouts:

  echo 5 > /sys/devices/platform/omap/omap-hsuart.0/sleep_timeout=20
  echo 5 > /sys/devices/platform/omap/omap-hsuart.1/sleep_timeout=20
  echo 5 > /sys/devices/platform/omap/omap-hsuart.2/sleep_timeout=20
  echo 5 > /sys/devices/platform/omap/omap-hsuart.3/sleep_timeout=20

It has to do more than not crash for this to be acceptable.   All UARTs
need to have the same capabilities.

Currently, UART4 has no padconf, wk_en, or wk_st fields set.  This mean=
s
1) it's sysfs entry  doesn't get a 'sleep_timeout' file so it cannot be
made changed and 2) wakeups on UART4 cannot work.

As I said before, you had all this stuff in a previous series.  I only
requested you drop the 'muxmode' stuff from that patch, but everything
else (padconf, wk_en, wk_st) was fine.

Please add this back to the series.
