Thanks for the suggestion; I'll hold on to that and push it after we add
the 8250 omap dma pause in mainline.

Well, instead of me saying something snide about the lack of upstream serial
driver unit tests, I'll say I've been working on cleaning up and organizing
my own tty/serial subsystem and driver units tests which I hope to upstream
in the fall.

Those include i/o validators that ran this driver for days at time without
error at max line rate. Unfortunately, that hardware does not exhibit the
same problem as the DRA7 noted in the changelog.
