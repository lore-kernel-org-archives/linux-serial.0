If we do not touch __of_address_to_resource after taddr is returned
by of_translate_address we will check for (flags & IORESOURCE_IO),
then we call pci_address_to_pio to retrieve the unique token (remember
that LPC driver will register the LPC io range to pci io_range_list).

I do not think that we can have any conflict with any other I/O space
as pci_register_io_range will guarantee that the LPC range does not
overlap with any other I/O range...
