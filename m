It still feels a bit odd. A hostile userspace could potentially find out
about what the kernel is doing. For example, if the deadline of the next
timer is accessible by reading that page, userspace could infer a lot of
things that we'd normally want to keep hidden. Not knowing this HW, I
cannot answer that question, but maybe you can.

Another question: MMIO accesses can be quite slow. How much do you gain
by having a vdso compared to executing a system call?

Thanks,
