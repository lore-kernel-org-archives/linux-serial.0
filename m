Yes threaded is just fine here at least for the cases I've seen.

PM runtime resume may need to bring up regulators, clocks and restore
the driver context etc.

Typo :) Both can be devm no problem.

Hmm probably the extra checks do not hurt there either.

Yeah it seems we might be able to eventually.
