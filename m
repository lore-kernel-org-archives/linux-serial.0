As I mentioned in the other thread, module wakeups are not the problem,
rather the module generating the interrupt is the problem.  So cutting
clocks outside prepare_for_idle path is not the problem.  It's the
re-enabling of the clocks that is important.

OK, I get the point.  You mentioned module level wakeups about 10 times
in this message.  ;)

However, rather than continue to hack around this problem we need to
understand the root cause.  Thanks to Paul, I think I undersand the roo=
t
cause as explained in the other thread, and I think there's a relativel=
y
easy way to make them work.

So here's an experiment to try with autosuspend.  I suspect this will
work, just hack it up to prove the concept.  If it works, we can make
something more generic.  Here are a few alternatives to try.  I may
experiment with some of them tomorrow as well, but please let me know
what you try:

Using autosuspend, clocks will get cut independently of the idle path.
Then, use the PRCM ISR detection of UART module wakeups to call the
UART's interrupt handler.  The interrupt handler will pm_runtime_get(),
enable the clocks, and then take care of the interrupt.  Done.

Alternatively, you could test it on current code by simply removing the
resume_from_idle call from the idle path and calling it instead from th=
e
PRCM ISR when UART module wakeups are detected.

Another option to experiment with: use PRCM ISR to trigger a SW
interrupt of the UART IRQ (cf. MPU_INTC.INTCPS_ISR_SETn registers.)
This may be the cleanest approach, and not require calling into the
driver, but I'm not sure if the normal interrupt clearing process will
also clear the SW interrupt.

The best longer-term solution is will be to use the chained PRCM
interrupt handler[1] (not yet finished.)  Using that, drivers could
directly register for their individual module wakeup interrupts.
