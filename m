What board, bootloader, and test steps did you use?  Can you post a dmesg?

The TRM could be buggy or wrong; or your patch could be correct as far as 
the UART goes, but could be triggering a separate bug.  We're reaching the 
end of the v3.9-rc fixes period, so we need to deal with the v3.9-rc 
regression quickly so folks don't wind up with a broken v3.9 kernel.  
Then the issue can be debugged and tested, and the revised fix targeted 
for the v3.11 kernel.

Could you be more specific about what information you're looking for, 
beyond what's in:

http://www.pwsan.com/omap/testlogs/test_v3.9-rc5/20130331205513/pm/37xxevm/37xxevm_log.txt 

?  As you can see from the log, it's using UART1 at 115kbps -- init=/bin/sh, 
so no userspace to speak of.

It's also worth mentioning that the 3730 Beagle XM here doesn't fail the 
PM test, UART3 at 230kbps in a "full" userspace:
