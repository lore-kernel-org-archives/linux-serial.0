Hi, Ben, Mark,

Thanks for your comments! These are helpful!

I have similar idea as your PPC MMIO.

We notice the prototype of {in/out()} is something like that:

static inline u8 inb(unsigned long addr)
static inline void outb(u8 value, unsigned long addr)

The type of parameter 'addr' is unsigned long. For I/O space, it is big enough.
So, could you divide this 'addr' into several bit segments? The top 8 bits is
defined as bus index. For normal direct IO, the bus index is 0. For those bus
device which need indirectIO or some special I/O accessors, when these devices
are initializing, can request to allocate an unique ID to them, and register
their own accessors to the entry which is corresponding to the ID.

In this way, we can support multiple domains, I think.
But I am not sure whether it is feasible, for example, are there some
architectures/platforms had populated the top 8 bits? Do we need to request IO
region from ioport_resource for those devices?  etc...


Thanks,
Zhichang
