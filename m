There are still NMI stacktraces - see here

When I observe these messages (usually with small log buffer size), it 
doesn't lockup.

The lockups happen because the messages are stuffed into a 2MiB buffer and 
then printed over 115200 baud serial line.

You can see this: 
http://people.redhat.com/~mpatocka/testcases/console-lockup/5.0-total-lockup.txt

Here it attempted to write 1355277 bytes over the slow serial line - it 
takes a few minutes.

Losing messages is in my opinion reasonable (if they are produced faster 
than they could be printed). Another possibility is to always write the 
message synchronously and exit printk only after it is written.
