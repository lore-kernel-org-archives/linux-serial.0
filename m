This scenario is because of print from
omap_uart_console_write --> get_sync --> omap_enable_enable
trying to print worst activate or deactivate latency some times.

will result in recursive print scenario.

holding console lock will only ensure that the print from get_sync gets
logged to be printed later to console.

ok.

scenario is same as said above.

omap_uart_console_write --> get_sync --> omap_device

printk worst activate latency calls omap_uart_console write.

after boot up we have access to console lock,
but during boot up we don't have console lock available
and results in printk recursiveness.

basically its due to recursive printk during bootup
and also after bootup as said above.

console_lock in runtime_suspend will not help
during bootup and due to printk emerging out from
omap_device enable after system bootup.

AFAIK it gets logged prints later.

to summarize holding console lock helps after bootup
since during boot up console lock is not available need to use
above runtime_status check.
