I didn't consider this as a feature.

So we had the 8250-DMA doing pause and all its current users implement
it. We have a DMA driver tree which is not used and it not implementing
pause (not implementing pause at all). Later we get a combo of 8250-DMA
+ DMA driver that is broken because the lack of pause and this is
noticed a few kernel releases later.
The only way of fixing the bug is by implementing the pause feature.
Now you are saying that even if I implement this missing feature in a
newer kernel I am not allowed to mark it stable despite the fact that
it fixes an existing problem in older kernels because it is not a
regression.

I already accepted this.
