The errata handling for i291 is moved from device code to driver code
but it's functionality is also changed (but not described.)

In the current mainline code, The workaround for i291 is done whenever
UART clocks are about to be cut.  When the clocks are (re)enabled, the
device is put back into no-idle.

This patch puts the device into force-idle just before the idle/suspend
transistion, but never puts it back into no-idle.  So after the first
idle/suspend transition, the IP remains in force-idle forever.  I don't
think that's what we want.
