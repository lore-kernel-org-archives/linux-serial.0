Ok. If a WT-cache is common enough, you could optimize for that
case by skipping the explicit writeback here and just doing a synchronizing
instruction. Usually if the cache is configurable, one would pick the
writeback option though, so it's probably not important.

Ok, makes sense.

This is one area that might need a more complex implementation then,
depending on what devices are used in other SoCs. For network or
storage devices, it's usually sufficient to configure a DMA mask
from the "dma-ranges" property of the parent bus in the device tree,
the kernel code will then use bounce buffers.

For other types of drivers, using the streaming DMA interfaces
can require using the swiotlb helper that performs the bounce
buffering at in place of the cache operations. With a bit of luck,
you won't ever need to worry about it, just mentioning it here in
case you run into that problem later.

The consistent_sync() implementaiton you showed earlier should be
good enough then.  With that change,
