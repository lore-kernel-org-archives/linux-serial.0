Okay. So this backtrace does not show more like from where the access
is happening?

Hmm. So you are not a friend of the udev solution?. For now the driver
is "default n" and you have to explicit enable it and _then_ you should
be able to update your command line, etc.
If I introduce a kernel proxy for compatibility I assume that people
will wake up once that compatibility piece is gone.

However, if you insist=85 I tried to make a symlink but nobody does thi=
s
in kernel. The "rtc -> rtc0" and friends seem to come from udev _or_
distro. So I sff could a second device node with the same major/minor.
That would work for userland but not for the kernel console=85 So we ne=
ed
a proxy-console for this.

Before I spent time on this proxy-console I would like to hear from Gre=
g
that he is okay with this.
