Not sure if it's the same problem but with 3530 on 3.2 with
sleep_timeout set, I usually get first char dropped (as expected) but
sometimes I get corrupted char instead too. Corrupt char seems to
almost always happen if I set cpufreq to powersave, on performace it's
almost always ok, so maybe it's some timing problem,
