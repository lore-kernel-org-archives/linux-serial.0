Perhaps a proper solution would be to drop excessive messages to serial 
console unless Oops or BUG has happened?

Because we don't want to kill the filesystem. dm-integrity detects an 
error and returns the error code to md-raid5. md-raid5 recalculates the 
correct data from the remaining disks. And then, md-raid5 submits the 
correct data to the filesystem and also writes the correct data to the 
device that had the error.

In a real-life scenario, there would be few errors. When we are testing 
it, we deliberately create a device with all errorneous sectors.

I made a patch that rate-limits the message. But still, killing the 
machine is wrong.
