No it is not.  "no such device" means "the device is not present".  If
the device is not present, we wouldn't have a struct device associated
with it.

The missing resource is an error condition: what it's saying is that the
device is there, but something has failed in providing the IO regions
necessary to access it.  That's really something very different from
"there is no device present".

As is arguing that -ENODEV is an appropriate return value for the missing
resource.

Moreover, returning -ENODEV is actually *bad* in this case - the kernel's
generic probe handling does not report the failure of the driver to bind
given this, so a missing resource potentially becomes a silent failure of
a driver - leading users to wonder why their devices aren't found.

If we /really/ have a problem with the error code, then why not invent
a new error code to cater for this condition - maybe, EBADRES (bad resource).

$ grep devm_ioremap_resource drivers/tty/serial/ -r | wc -l
10

It seems that statement is false.
