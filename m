I'm not sure we should use ttyS for it. ttyS means 8250, a lot of
existing code knows what ttyS is and what sort of ioctls and the like are
assumed. A generic namespace needs not to be attached to a legacy naming 

(eg also put all serial ports in /dev/serial/0 /dev/serial/1 etc either
via the tty layer or via systemd/udev)
