Is it okay to read the port flags to identify the port state in
driver whether the serial port shutdown ops is called from
port_suspend or due to port closure.

Since port_shutdown gets called even from uart_suspend_port

Is things like

test_bit(ASYNCB_SUSPENDED, &port->flags);
or
test_bit(ASYNCB_CLOSING, &port->flags);

allowed in low level driver ?
