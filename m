Yes, but there are deadlocks caused when low_latency is set. Simply
because flush_to_ldisc calls tty->ops->flush_chars from ldisc's
receive_buf. And some drivers take a lock there. But they already hold
the lock from the site where they call tty_schedule_flip from.

Yes, but not all call tty_flip_buffer_push correctly. If you set
low_latency for them, they explode.
