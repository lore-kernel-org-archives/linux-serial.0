Just to summarize on how the behavior should be IIUC if user disables u=
art
wakeup from sysfs and does system wide suspend it should _not_ wakeup
from uart.

And if the system is woken up from suspend due to keypad press and
uart resumes we have keep module level wakeup enabled from here.

We might need some minor changes in omap-serial to have this behavior
which I plan to do once we are aligned on this.
