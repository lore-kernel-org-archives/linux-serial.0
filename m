The OMAP UART needs the RX-DMA programmed right away. If we receive a BREAK
then we have to cancel the DMA transfer before we can handle the break
condition. Otherwise, after we handled the "break condition" the DMA
engine will start reading bytes from the FIFO while we also purge the
FIFO manually. The order of what we receive is random.

Also sometimes the OMAP UART does not signal the DMA engine to unload
the FIFO. Usually this happens when we have >threshold bytes in the FIFO
and start the DMA transfer. It seems that in those cases the UART won't
trigger the transfer once the requested threshold is reached. In some
rare cases the UART does not trigger the DMA transfer even if programmed
while the FIFO was empty.
In those cases the UART drops an RDI event and we have to empty the FIFO
manually. If we ignore it because the DMA transfer is programmed then we
will enter the function a few times until we receive the RX_TIMEOUT
event. At that point the FIFO is usually full and we risk to overflow
the FIFO.
