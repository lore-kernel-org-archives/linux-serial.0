[ This series is targeted for merging during v3.3-rc ]

On v3.3-rc1, the OMAP serial console doesn't behave properly when
power management is enabled (the default with omap2plus_defconfig).
This seems to be due to a combination of a silicon bug in the UART IP
block and broken FIFO settings in the OMAP serial driver.

This patch series attempts to work around these problems.  The workarounds
are not perfect; see the patch descriptions for more details.

Tested on OMAP3530 BeagleBoard.  This series will need to be tested on
OMAP2 and OMAP4 before it is ready to merge.
