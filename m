I doubt that. What I see from a timer debug is that the TX-FIFO level
is at 0, the DMA transfer for say 1024 bytes start.
The FIFO is filled to 64bytes and refilled so it doesn't drop below 50.
At the time of the stall I see that the DMA engine has outstanding
bytes which it should transfer and the TX FIFO is empty. If hardware
flow control stops the transfer, I would expect that the DMA engine
still fills the TX-FIFO until 64 and then waits. But it doesn't.
Writing bytes into the FIFO leads to bytes beeing sent (and I see them
on the other side) but the DMA transfer is still on hold. Canceling the
DMA transfer and re-programming the remaining bytes transfers the
remaining bytes.

The odd thing is that I only triggered it with "less file". It doesn't
happen on regular console interaction or "cat large-file". And it only
triggers on beagle board xm (omap34xx) and I wasn't able to reproduce
it on am335x or dra7. The latter shares the same DMA engine as beagle
board xm.

I remember also that I disabled the HW/SW float control just to make
sure it is not it.
