How about reporting that as a bug then, because if you look back in the
git history, as you are fully capable of, you will find that the slave
capability stuff went in _after_ omap-dma, and *many* DMA engine drivers
have not been updated.  Here, let me do _your_ work for you:

    dmaengine: Create a generic dma_slave_caps callback

    dmaengine: omap: Add support for pause/resume in cyclic dma mode

Oh look, omap-dma pre-dates the creation of dma_slave_caps by over two
years!

However, it's *not* as trivial as you think: the dma_slave_caps() call
has no knowledge whether a channel will be used in cyclic mode or not,
or which direction it will be used.  So, it really _can't_ report
whether pause mode is supported or not.  So actually, this is something
that can't be fixed trivially, and was a detail missed when the slave
caps was reviewed (I probably missed the review or missed the point.)

So, how about you stop playing the blame game and trying to shovel your
shit onto DMA engine.
