That's definitely one way of doing it, yes :).

You still don't need extio on architectures that have native PIO or no 
PIO devices at all. So I wouldn't mind if you keep it as a config 
option. That way archs that don't care can reduce their code size.

But I don't feel strongly about it either way.
