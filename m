I don't think fixing disable_irq_nosync here is not needed without
fixing the rest. We're currently never calling serial_omap_enable_wakeup
from the runtime PM resume path.

So serial_omap_enable_wakeirq(up, 0) would only get called in the case
of device_may_wakeup disabled from serial_omap_runtime_suspend, which is
not called from the interrupt context.

Yes at least when serial-omap is runtime PM enabled and doing a suspend
without device_may_wakeup being set.

I'd like to get rid of the wakeups_enabled, but it's probably safest to do
that when ripping out the remaining context_loos_cnt stuff after we've made
omap3 to boot also in device tree only mode.

Tony
