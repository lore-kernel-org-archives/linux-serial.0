Following a previous discussion with Arnd:
<< We know that the ISA/LPC bus can only have up to 65536 ports,
so you can register all of those, or possibly limit it further to
1024 or 4096 ports, whichever matches the bus implementation. >>
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/11/10/95)

We decided to register a fixed IO range for our LPC.
About the specific reason for choosing 0x400 I think Zhichang can
clarify once he's back (he's OOO now)

Thanks for the heads-up. We'll discuss internally after Chinese holidays
to understand if this implementation is compatible with the intended
deployment scenarions

Maybe you're right :)

Looking at extio.c we never return a 64b value.
I'll double check with Zhichang once he's back...
