I would prefer the waitqueue approach.
You can't do this while holding the port lock. The lock is taken with
irqs off so may not see the transfer completing.
Why do you pause the channel? It may not work without an active
descriptor and a start without "resume" should work. Also you must
ensure that DMA's complete callback does not start another transfer if
there is something queued up (that is why I had the tx_running dance).
I am not sure if a transfer that is active and then paused will not
trigger the hang bug if we change the termios in between.
