Indeed. It was that long list that originally provoked me to comment in 
the first place.

For the all reset bits:

   clock idx = reset idx + 256

The opposite is not true; the clock bits are a superset of the reset 
bits (the reset bits act on cells but some cells have >1 clock).

I'd wondered about doing that.

It will certainly work but it seemed a bit odd to me to have one (really 
tiny) part of the RCC cell included seperately in the platform 
description whilst all the complicated bits end up aggregated into the 
RCC cell.

Is there much prior art that uses this type of trick to avoid having 
magic numbers into the bindings?

No. They mostly run to the core and its intimate peripherals (i.e. only 
reset line comes from WDT).

That would suit me very well (although is the 0x20/0x40 not the 8 that 
we would need in the middle column).

Maxime: Does that suit reset driver?


Daniel.
