Ouch that's an old and obsolete and insecure kernel version that is
hundreds of thousands of fixes and changes old :(

Please ask for support from the vendor that is forcing you to use such a
beast, you are paying for it, might as well take advantage of it.
Nothing the kernel community can do, sorry.

Note, if you can reproduce this on 4.8-rc2 or even 4.7.1, we will be
glad to help out here.

Best of luck,
