=46orgot to add, this is still needed for
earlyprintk(CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK) use case,

The initial boot prints until a console driver is available is from
"arch/arm/kernel/early_printk.c" which does a tx on uart console
and relies on configuration from bootloader.

during bootup earlyprink does a tx on uart console and if  uart driver
is not available yet
uart reset or idle done by hwmod layer can cause boot failures.

--> put_char from earlyprintk.c
     --> reset/idle from hwmod layer
          --> put_char from earlyprintk.c


So console_uart reset or clock gating must be done only after uart
driver is available or be prevented
using these available hwmod_flags.

omap_serial_early_init should be now be binded with CONFIG_SERIAL_OMAP =
macro ?
