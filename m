We have the DT pieces since v3.19-rc1. And if I remember correctly I
tested this on am335x-evm and dra7-evm by I the time I posted the
patches. I agree that dra7 support was not the best back then but I am
almost sure that I had vanilla running for testing.
But I don't insist on the stable tag. Consider it dropped.

yes, but I had in mind is to put the loop into one function so we gain:

+static void omap_dma_drain_chan(struct omap_chan *c)
+{
+       int i;
+       uint32_t val;
+
+       /* Wait for sDMA FIFO to drain */
+       for (i = 0; ; i++) {
+               val = omap_dma_chan_read(c, CCR);
+               if (!(val & (CCR_RD_ACTIVE | CCR_WR_ACTIVE)))
+                       break;
+
+               if (i > 100)
+                       break;
+
+               udelay(5);
+       }
+
+       if (val & (CCR_RD_ACTIVE | CCR_WR_ACTIVE))
+               dev_err(c->vc.chan.device->dev,
+                       "DMA drain did not complete on lch %d\n",
+                       c->dma_ch);
+}

which is invoked by both parts of the if case (handling the errata not
not) instead of having the same loop twice.

good.
