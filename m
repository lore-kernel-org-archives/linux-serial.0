OK.  Current patch should do only this part.  The rest should be
separate patches with their own descriptive changelogs.

This part should be a separate patch that follows.

As stated in previous reviews, this wakeup enable/disable needs more
description as the functionality is changing compared to current code.

Current version modifies wakeup enable/disable at both power-domain
level (PM_WKEN) and at the IO ring. 

Updated version modifies wakeups at module-level (SYSCONFIG) and at IO
ring using omap_hwmod_enable_wakeup()

IMO, the updated version makes more sense, but needs a description as to
why that change in functionality will have equivalent results compared
to the existing one.

OK, good.
