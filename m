I mean you should not need the auxdata entry if the driver does everything
right, and you get rid of the platform_data.

(adding linux-serial to Cc)

Generally speaking, drivers should not have static or fixed-size arrays of
devices in them. What you should do instead is to allocate the arc_uart_port
at from arc_serial_probe() and remove all the references to the global
array. I'm not completely sure if that's possible with the uart_port yet,
maybe someone else can comment on that.

For the id value, have a look at the drivers/tty/serial/mxs-auart.c and how
it gets the id from the /aliases node in the device tree using
of_alias_get_id().
