Well, if we use the compatible string for this, we will have to add :
- atmel,sama5d2-usart
- atmel,sama5d3-usart
- (maybe others ?)
to the already existing :
- atmel,at91sam9260-usart
- atmel,at91rm9200-usart
just for setting different limits on the fidi register.
IMHO, it seems a bit overkill. Moreover, the ATMEL_US_VERSION has
already been read, so...
But if you think adding compatible strings is a better/cleaner solution, just convince me ! :)
