printk() could not easily detect where the messages come from and
if it is acceptable to drop them.

In general, an "unlimited" output of messages that are not much useful
looks like a bug on the caller side. Some rate-limiting in
dm-integrity code looks appropriate here.

Even better might be to stop printing the messages after X occurrences
until the check is completed. It might do something like:

int errors_count =3D 0;

while(find_error()) {
	errors_count++;
	if (errors_count <=3D 10)
		pr_err("...");
	else if (errors_count =3D=3D 11)
		pr_error(=A8Too many errors. Continuing check silently\n");
}

if (errors_count)
	pr_error("Check finished. %d errors detected\n", errors_count);


Note that rate-limit is a bit ugly. It does not have feedback from
printk/consoles how long it takes to get the messages out. It might
not be enough if the console is very slow and if there are other
printk() users at the same time.


That said. I agree that printk() should not kill the system. It should
survive these "mistakes". On the other hand, printk() users must
cooperate. The log buffer and console bandwith is a limited resource.
