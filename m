The reason why this driver is not using threaded irqs is that it already has a kthread to handle other things. Having two threads per port seems like a big waste plus we may need some additional locking between them. Can we just return IRQ_WAKE_THREAD from the handler?

IMHO drivers should be perfectly fine to have their own threaded irq setups and core needs to support it.
