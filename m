The reason it works currently is because we are aquiring console
lock in omap_serial_init since with the patch series cleanup and
things are moving to driver I see this issue.

The issue is due to recursive prints because of get_sync/put_sync
printing active/deactivate latency from omap_device layer.

During printk -> uart_console_write -->
we do get_sync and if clock is cut and omap_device_enable
gets called and omap_device_enable trying to pr_warn
activate latency.
Here we end up in recursive lock up from printk.
