Currently, tcflow(TCIOFF/TCION) ignores the flow control modes and always
sends XON/XOFF, so disabling DMA based on flow control mode won't work.

Sebastian really confused this problem by relating it to low latency.
That's not the problem.

The problem is that softirqs and tasklets are not reliable bottom halves
anymore, because since 3.8 they don't always run when interrupts are
re-enabled. They can now be deferred to the lowest priority process,
ksoftirqd.

For a uart trying not to overrun a 64-byte fifo at 3Mbaud creates a hard
213us deadline for the uart driver to give the dmaengine driver the
_next_ RX buffer to fill. Right now, the 8250 driver is only using 1
RX buffer, so until the DMA completion handler runs (in tasklet), the
8250 driver doesn't supply the dmaengine driver a new one.

Yes, that's one possible alternative. The drawback is that makes
testing more difficult, but maybe the tradeoff would be worth it.
