response is slower like when we type something or cat debugfs/pm_count
see things little slower on console, there is no character loss.

Happens even though we have not set the autosuspend timeout and uart
clocks are active,
which basically means allowing mpu to enter retention keeping uart acti=
ve.

this delay in response or sluggishness is not there on my 3430SDP or
3630zoom board but I was able to see this behavior on a beagle board(xm=
 rev c).

retaining this uart_can_sleep check in omap3_can_sleep ensures a better
console user experience. (not allowing mpu to enter retention
until uart clocks are cut)

removing uart_list caused this ops, retaining uart_list
will ensure this will be replaced with list_for_each_entry
as done in existing code.
