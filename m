Exactly.  Driver's can currently check device_may_wakeup(dev) to
determine if they *should* set wakeup flags, but currently, we don't
have a clean way to pass the info down to core code.

One possible option (albeit hacky) is for the omap_hwmod_mux code to
check device_may_wakeup() itself, and set the bits accordingly.  This
means drivers don't have to do anything, but drivers also loose control
of enabling/disabling wakeups.

I think what we need are two omap_device-level APIs for wakeups.

One for enable/disable of wakeups (both module-level and IO-ring, the 
driver should not care about the difference between the two):

int omap_device_[enable|disable](struct platform_device *pdev);

bool omap_device_wakeup_occured(struct platform_device *pdev);

As OMAP-specific APIs, both of these should of course be called through
pdata function pointers.
