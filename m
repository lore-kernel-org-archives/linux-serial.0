I assume we use raw mode:
- We call the cfmakeraw() function.
- We also set the O_NDELAY flag, VMIN = 1, VTIME = 0

I think you are right: I did not yet do "real" analysis on the N_TTY
line discipline apart from source code analysis.
I will do some extra ftrace tests, to find out what causes the delays
in the execution time.
I'll come back to that...

No, it is a UART peripheral in a FPGA on our target board.
We use a self written serial_core base driver
