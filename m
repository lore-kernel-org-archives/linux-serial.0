Actually when we call a API to enable clocks we except the internals of API
to just enable clocks and return.

*Clock enable API should not cause or trigger to do a _device_driver_operation_
even before enabling clocks of the device-driver which called it*

for uart context get_sync can land me to uart driver back
even before enabling the uart clocks due to printks.

Yes deadlocks. due to entering from runtime context to runtime context
or entering from uart_port_operation to uart_console_write ops.

There are already port locks used extensively within the uart driver
to secure a port operation.

But cannot secure a port operation while using clock_enable API.
since clock enable API can land the control back to uart_console_write
operation..

I had done some investigations, from scenarios it simply boils down to fact
to handle clock within uart driver, uart driver expects clock enable API* used
to just enable uart clocks but rather not trigger a _uart_ops_ within which
kind of unacceptable from the uart_driver context.

*clock enable API can be any API used to enable clocks like
get_sync/ omap_device_enable/clock_enable etc.
