omap-serial uses a UART RX FIFO trigger of 1 byte whereas 8250_omap
driver uses a RX FIFO trigger of 48 bytes. If less than 48 bytes is
received then RX Timeout interrupt is raised which will help the driver
to flush the FIFO. It seems like RX timeout does not seem to bring out
UART IP from idle state on OMAP5.

I have posted a fix based on what is done for DRA7 in hwmod code:
