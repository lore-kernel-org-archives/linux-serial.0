The reason is that you are seeing data being printed on the console. The
watchdogs (soft, hard, rcu, nmi) are all touched with each emergency
message.

You are correct. Making prb_lock fair might be something we want to look
into. Perhaps also based on the loglevel of what needs to be
printed. (For example, KERN_ALERT always wins over KERN_CRIT.)

Yes, you are referring to a worst case. We could have local_irqs
disabled on every CPU while every CPU is hit with an NMI and all those
NMIs want to dump a load of messages. The rest of the system will be
frozen until those NMI printers can finish. But that is still not a
lock-up. At some point those printers should finish and eventually the
system should be able to resume.
