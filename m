So with respect to this patchset once we enter the
"taddr == OF_BAD_ADDR" case you would add an arch
specific function that checks if the resource is an I/O 
resource, if the parent node is an ISA bus (calling 
of_bus_isa_match) and if arm64_extio_ops is non NULL. 
 
I think it can work for us and it doesn't affect current
devices. I will talk to Zhichang about this for the next
patchset version.

Many Thanks for your ideas
