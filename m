We run an application with a real-time thread, running on a high priori=
ty.
This thread does serial communication, using non blocking read/write
file I/O on a tty device, with small amounts of data (=3D 24 bytes).
This application runs on a AT2AM9261 processor, 200 MHz
The maximum execution time of both the read & write go up to 200 us

We use non blocking read & write functions
We would like the read/write functions to always execute less than 100u=
s

We use a self written serial_core device uart driver that implements a
driver for a UART peripheral in a FPGA on our target board..
