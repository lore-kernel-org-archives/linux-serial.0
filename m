Correct.

Keypad press, or any other wakeup source, yes.

Basically, UART wakeups (module and IO) should be enabled all the time,
*except* when suspending and wakeups were disabled by sysfs control.

Sure, this changes previous behavior based on assumptions that are no
longer true (namely, UARTs only disabled in idle path), so I would
expect some changes.
