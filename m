BTW, I'll point out a fatal flaw in your justification above.

If you read the entire example, you'll see that the is_suspended flag
is _not_ used to prevent resumes without suspends, but is used as a
flag to control whether the driver processes requests or not.  That's
entirely functionally different from using a "is_suspended" flag in
the way you mention above.

Section 5 is quite clear about the requirements at initialization time
for runtime PM, and nothing in section 9 contradicts that, and the
is_suspended flag in that example has nothing to do with any of this.
