Let's back up here and focus on just this problem for now.

Since this is observable on dra7/sdma, then it's not related to
the OMAP_DMA_TX_KICK problem. IOW, dropping tx dma support for am335x
does not make this go away, which is what I was asking.

Now, if the DLL/DLH/MDR1 register writes are causing dma to stall,
then skipping those if they're unchanged should fix this, and then
pause/terminating in-progress DMA if any of these registers are being
written would be acceptable since some data loss is to be expected
when changing the baud rate without waiting.
