This should be rather discussed in the thread about the new printk
implementation.

Anyway, the first version should be acceptable even with the unfair
lock. Please, do not spend time on this now.

There is a bigger problem with the lock. It is not NMI safe as I wrote
in
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190227135504.gqtcsdwpy4rd7xvs@pathway.suse.cz
Therefore I am not sure if we could use it at all.

We must keep it as a fallback as long as the "few" group is important
enough for users.

This can be solved by a configuration setting. Real-time kernels
might do the offloading more aggressively.
