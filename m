The dev entry had to be different with serial-omap as it was not
using 8250 code. With the code moving back to using 8250 code
there are no dev conflicts so ttyS is just fine as the 8250 code
handles allocating the devices.

Yes the 8250 code should always use ttyS. Then maybe we could
have also ttyO dev entries created by the driver for compability.

Earlier serial-omap could not provide the ttyS compability easily
because they were separate drivers.
