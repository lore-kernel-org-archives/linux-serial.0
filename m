I think "ranges" is needed.
without this, of_translate_address --> __of_translate_address --> of_translate_one will fail when translating the child's IO resource.

The hip06 LPC is defined as isa type.
So, 0x01 0xe4 is the local IO address of 0xe4. With this ranges, 0xe4 of child will be 1:1 mapped as 0xe4.
It means no translation.

Just as we discussed in V2, the legacy PIO range is specific to some device, such as for ipmi bt, 0xe4 - 0xe7 will be populated.
I don't want to occupy a larger PIO range in which only small part PIOs are used by our LPC. At this moment, two PIO ranges are using
through the device property configuration, 0xe4-0xe7, 0x2f8-0x2ff.
If we configure 0-0x1000 for the LPC to cover those two ranges, most PIO are wasted and other PIO device on other buses lose the chance to use the PIO below 0x1000.
Otherwise, PIO conflict will happen. So, My idea is only occupied the PIO ranges which are really needed for the children.

And there are probably multiple child devices under LPC, the global arm64_extio_ops only can cover one PIO range. It is fortunate only ipmi driver can not support I/O
operation registering, serial driver has serial_in/serial_out to be registered. So, only the PIO range for ipmi device is stored in arm64_extio_ops and the indirect-IO
works well for ipmi device.

If we think it is nearly no chance that LPC PIO range conflict with other buses, we can allocate 0xe4 - 0x2ff to LPC and store it to arm64_extio_ops. In this case,
the special processing for ipmi device is not needed.
