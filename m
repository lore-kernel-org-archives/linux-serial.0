Well so negative autosuspend delay is working as documented then :)

Yes the bug for closed ports needs to be fixed for sure.

Well if you have some better mechanism in mind let's try it out. Short of
sprinkling pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume calls all over, I'm out of ideas
right now.

Only in some cases will the serdev driver know it's safe to configure
the parent controller. Configuring the parent controller from userspace
works just fine as we've seen for years now.

Yeah let's stick with configuring the parent controller from userspace
for now at least.

OK yeah some additional on/off switch seems to be missing here.

OK. So if I understand your idea right, we could have autosuspend timeout
set to 3000ms in the 8250_omap.c but still default to RPM blocked?
Then user can enable aggressive PM via /sys as desired, right?
