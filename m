Nice to see the this disappearing.

As stated in the previous review.  Patches that move code/features
should have the removal and the add-back in the same patch.  Doing so
makes it easy for reviewers to see whether it was simply moved, or if it
was modified when it was moved, etc.

Again, remove it here in the patch that adds that support (the errata
patch I guess.)

So basically, this patch should only remove the legacy 8250 support (as
the subject says) and everything else should be done in the other
relevant patches.
