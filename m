Update:

Populating following changes for v3:
Will be posting in couple of days.

1.)  Replace platform_get_resource with platform_get_resource_byname
     Reference :
     http://marc.info/?l=3Dlinux-omap&m=3D127479257522952&w=3D2

2.)  Update kconfig to add OMAP2 support also
      [Thanks to Kevin for testing it on n810(omap2)]
      Reference :
     http://marc.info/?l=3Dlinux-serial&m=3D127491414713957&w=3D2

Please let me know if there are any further comments.
Thanks for the reviews and testing.
