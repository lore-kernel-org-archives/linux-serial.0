Looks good to me, i..e., in line with what one could expect.  However, ...

Not being able to discover more coding bugs in the code modified by the series, 
I'm wondering if the reason for the issue you are observing comes from the 
fact both pins are no longer manipulated together within a single 
.set_multiple() chip callback. I'm working on a fix which prevents from that.
