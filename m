Yes, Its between power and performance, current way gives a better
response for most devices. (specially while downloading the firmware fo=
r
external chip initialization and other use cases)

Yes I had done that long time back, gives a little edge for
throughput(probably even PM
but haven't checked though) but many users of driver are hesitant to
modify their user space
apps to pass buffer size (modify the bt stack or the gps stack) and
sometimes even those
stacks are unaware of incoming sizes.

Many expect to work as is when hooked up to the user space stack withou=
t
any changes.
