Poll rate is used for doing tty_insert_flip_string for pushing data to
user space
to keep faster response to any client device over uart, some Bt chips
expect faster
response when data on uart arrives and packet should be pushed out immediat=
ely.

its for tty_insert pushing data to tty stack.

yes we maintain 3 secs timeout period and keep uart active in DMA case.
since rx is asynchronous we cant afford to stop and start dma every time af=
ter
x bytes after every rx data completion call back.
