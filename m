That seems rather unlikely.  And I don't agree that there is a balance to=
=20
be struck in this case.  Compared to a correctly-working RX PIO path, the=
=20
RX DMA in the current driver is likely to be much worse in energy=20
consumption, and to be equal at best in receive latency.

In a correctly-working RX PIO path, the driver is going to receive an=20
interrupt the moment the data is ready to be transferred from the FIFO. =20
The driver doesn't have to wait for a polling timer to fire and execute. =
=20
Nor does the ISR have to compete with a 1 microsecond polling timer for=20
the CPU.

And I doubt that an accurate comparison could have been made between the=20
PIO and DMA RX paths.  In the current driver, the PIO RX FIFO threshold=20
was set to 16 bytes, while the DMA RX FIFO threshold in the DMA path was=20
set to 1 byte.  So I'm hardly surprised that the RX DMA path looked good=20
under those circumstances.  The current driver is sufficiently broken that=
=20
any benchmarks based on it are suspect.  And in many cases, the way that=20
the driver works around its problems is by effectively disabling system=20
power management.

Downloading firmware to an external chip uses the transmit path, not the=20
receive path.  So that is an orthogonal case.

In terms of transmit, it's hardly surprising that the TX DMA path would=20
outperform the driver's current TX PIO path.  For one thing, the FIFO=20
handling in the current TX PIO path is broken.  The driver doesn't even=20
use 75% of the TX FIFO.  Also, the transmission of a large block of data=20
is not sensitive to MPU wakeup latency the same way that RX DMA is.  A=20
large block of data can be queued to be transmitted, and the MPU doesn't=20
need to wake up again until the SDMA has finished handing off that data to=
=20
the UART FIFO.  At that point the kernel has plenty of time to prepare the=
=20
next buffer.
