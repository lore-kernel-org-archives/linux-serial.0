and by that logic when you query the driver would have freed up!

well that can be achieved properly and differently!
Why don't we pause the channel, get the residue, status and then
terminate.

Due to the special nature of terminate. The point here is that you don'=
t
terminate a transaction but channel operation

Yes but would above flow work for you :)
