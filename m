Thanks for this information; I see I was wrong about the cause of message.

I think what happens during startup is that on this silicon clearing
the rx fifo (by serial8250_clear_fifos()) clears data ready but not
the rx timeout condition which causes a spurious rx interrupt when
interrupts are enabled.

So caught between two broken UARTs: one that underflows its rx fifo because
of unsolicited rx reads and the other that generates spurious interrupt
without unsolicited rx reads.

Yes, IIR == UART_IIR_RX_TIMEOUT is to used indicate that data is in the rx fifo
but has not reached the rx trigger level yet.

ATM, I'm not exactly sure if there is a safe way to clear the spurious interrupt
from the interrupt handler.

I'm fairly certain the only way to clear the rx timeout interrupt is to read
the rx fifo, but I think this would race with actual data arrival. IOW, there
might not be a way to determine if the data read is spurious or not.
