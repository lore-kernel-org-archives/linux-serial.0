Doing the threaded interrupt change on the 8250 driver doesn't seem as
trivial. Unless I'm mistaken, that version of this patch would mess with
all other 8250 based serial drivers, if it's done properly. Incidentally
I did try using threadirqs, but that didn't give my any significant
results. I mostly noticed a difference in the console.

I haven't had time yet to look into this any further. I'll accept that
this patch may fix a case most people aren't the least interested in.
I'll also happily accept that I probably need a better argumentation
than "this works better for us".Would it make sense to drop this patch
and resubmit the other three? As I mentioned in the previous run, I
think these are useful in any case.

Thanks,
Frans
