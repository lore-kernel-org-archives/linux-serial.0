Well that's good news that it exists on 36xx+ at least.
 
But please make a few changes.

This shouldn't set this bit on UARTs that don't support it.  It should 
only be set if a hwmod dev_attr flag was set to indicate the presence of 
this feature.  Using a flag is also important since it will allow us to 
disable the workaround that we'll need for earlier OMAPs.

Also, I assume that this does not fix the RX sluggishness due to the 
missing RX timeout wakeup?

Also, this assignment should be using symbolic macros rather than raw 
bits.
