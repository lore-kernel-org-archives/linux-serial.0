Yes, that satisfies one of my suggestions above.

Exactly - I don't believe that existing OMAP DMA hardware can ever support
pausing a mem-to-device transfer without data loss as you have no idea
how many bytes have been prefetched by the DMA, and therefore you have
no idea how many bytes to unwind the hardware position.  It gets worse
than that when you have to cross into the previous descriptor.  It's
really not nice.

So, disallowing pause for mem-to-device is entirely reasonable given the
data loss implications.
