According to John above, dra7/sdma requires this workaround.

That's hardly all that is required.

1. edma pause returns an error if the descriptor has already been retired
   when a pause is attempted. This makes distinguishing between reporting an
   error for unsupported feature indistinguishable from a transient dma
   error that can simply be logged.
2. The question of a spurious uart interrupt with every dma transaction
   on am335x is still unanswered.
3. Handling XON/XOFF transmit is mandatory; I don't see a way to do that
   without pause/resume.
4. Since virt-dma uses tasklets which since 3.8 are no longer serviced
   in a timely manner, rx dma is unreliable, since it's often kicked out
   to regular interrupts.
5. omap dma maintenance is not keeping up with baseline dma.


IOW, omap dma has turned into one big tangle of workarounds.

Let's start with making a list of which TI designs need which workarounds.

*am335x*
- requires write to tx fifo to trigger tx dma (ie. OMAP_DMA_TX_KICK
  workaround necessitating completely different tx dma completion handler)
- requires rx dma already queued before UART data ready interrupt
  (ie., necessitates completely different irq handler and rx dma completion
  handler)
- hangs changing some unknown register if tx dma in progress
  (ie., this termios change workaround)
- generates spurious uart interrupt for every rx dma transaction
  (ie., necessitates acking every UART interrupt, even UART_IIR_NO_INT)
  _Even with this workaround_, it still generates spurious interrupt warning
  which shuts off interrupts for several ms while logging the error
  message to the console, virtually guaranteeing lost data.


Can any TI design use the baseline 8250 tx dma transaction flow without
workarounds?  I know the am335x can't; any others?
