You should only add Reviewed-by if Alan or me have replied with it.

So far I've only replied with some comments that have not yet
been fixed, so we're few more steps from being Reviewd-by.

There's absolutely no need for having Kconfig options for the DMA
support. Please pass that in platform_data from the board-*.c files.

This is the third time I'm commenting on the same issue!

What's the point of posting these patches for review if the issues
don't get solved?
