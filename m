As I've mentioned in previous reviews, when no_console_suspend is
enabled, the user has explicitly requested console output during
suspend.  In order to support that, we should not be cutting clocks at
all in that mode.

One way to address this would be to just disable runtime PM in the
->prepare method of the driver if no_console_suspend is enabled.

Not sure why this is relevant.

Please revisit use of #ifdefs.  (c.f. #ifdefs are ugly in
Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
