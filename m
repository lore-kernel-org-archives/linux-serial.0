That won't work either as a negative autosuspend delay prevents runtime
suspend completely (by grabbing an extra RPM reference).

Yes, but it's not really the case today as since omap-serial (and
8250-omap) sets a negative autosuspend at probe and hence does not
runtime-suspend when the port is closed. So that's the long-standing bug
which needs fixing.

The implications of a negative autosuspend delay are already documented
(in Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt); it's just the omap drivers that
gets it wrong when trying to do things which aren't currently supported
(and never have been).

So I still think we need a new mechanism for this.

Is it really the job of a serdev driver to set the autosuspend delay of
a parent controller? Isn't this somethings which depends on the
characteristics of the controller (possibly configurable by user space)
such as the cost of runtime suspending and resuming?

The patch I posted works with what we have today; if a parent serial
controller driver uses aggressive runtime PM by default or after having
been configured through sysfs to do so.

What I'm getting at here is that the delay should be set by the serial
driver implementing aggressive runtime PM. Then all we need is a
mechanism to determine whether an extra RPM reference should be taken at
tty open or not (configurable by user space, defaulting to yes).

Specifically, the serial drivers themselves would always use
autosuspend and not have to deal with supporting the two RPM schemes
(normal vs aggressive runtime PM).

Thanks,
Johan
