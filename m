Then we only need to explicitly assign ports 0x80, 0x81, 0x99, etc to the LPC bridge and leave the rest for grabs (by PCI hotplug for example)

I worry I don't completely catch your idea.

But for our LPC, firmware configurations only tell kernel what is the IO resource of the peripherals under LPC. But to register the io range in the similar way of pci_register_io_range(), at least, we need to know the IO range size.
So, how to know this?
There is no similar BAR design in LPC, do we traverse all the peripherals to calculate that?

O. Do you mean that we can replace spin_lock_irqsave with spin_lock?

As we can connect UART to LPC, I worry the LPC can be accessed in the interrupt context.
