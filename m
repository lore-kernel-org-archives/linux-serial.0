Okay. Wasn't aware that Alan already suggested that.
I also need a watchdog timer for TX since it seems that on omap3 the
DMA engine suddenly forgets to continue with DMA=E2=80=A6

If this is really what we want, I would need to refactor a few things=E2=
=80=A6

keep in mind that both (RX & TX bugs/hacks) need also a bit of handling
in the 8250-core so it works together (like the tx_err member so we
fall back to manual xmit)
