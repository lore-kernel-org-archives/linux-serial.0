Note that there is already an include/linux/amba/pl08x.h.
I would just move the few parts of pl080.h that are actually
needed with global visibility there, and move the rest
to drivers/dma/.

Ack on the linux/sizes.h, that definitely makes sense.

I'm not sure I want to spread readsl/writesl beyond the architectures
that already have it. Maybe instead change the driver to use ioread32_rep,
which is already available on all architectures and is defined the
same way as readsl on ARM.

This one on the other hand makes sense to be defined on all architectures
IMHO. I don't mind restricting the driver to ARM for now, but having
a generic writel_relaxed would be nice.
