Might be worth a try.  In theory, since the current UART driver sets the 
TX_EMPTY flag in the SCR register, the UART should only raise a TX 
interrupt when the FIFO + shift register are totally empty.  So hopefully 
you should only get one extra interrupt per TTY transmit operation.

Hmm that's doubtful.  If that's really so, then we should be seeing 
massive UART transmit problems.  I'd expect that the driver wouldn't be 
able to get any transmit buffers out the door at all before the UART's 
fclk is cut.

What's probably happening in this case is that the hwmod code is rewriting 
the UART SIDLEMODE bits in the hwmod code's _idle() function.  This gets 
called as part of the PM runtime suspend operation.  So it's bypassing 
your debugging hack :-)  The hwmod code expects to control the SYSCONFIG 
register bits itself, and the current way that the UART driver messes with 
the SYSCONFIG bits is a total hack that that hwmod code is not expecting.  
You could try disabling that behavior in _idle_sysc() by adding a hack to 
skip it if it's the UART3 hwmod.

That's only true if the clockdomain is programmed to use 
software-supervised idle.  CORE & PER should both be programmed to 
hardware-supervised idle by mach-omap2/pm34xx.c.  In that case, we let the 
PRCM put the clockdomain to sleep by itself.

Probably not -- I'd think that hardware-supervised idle wouldn't work at 
all if that were true.
