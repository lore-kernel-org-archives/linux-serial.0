It didn't deadlock the machine. It was a typical soft lockup. Printing
CPU loop-ed in console_unlock() with preemption disabled; soft lockup
hrtimer was running on that CPU, but due to disabled preemption around
console_unlock() soft lockup's per-CPU kthread could not get scheduled
and could not update per-CPU touch_ts. Soft lockup hrtimer detected it:

[ 5128.552442] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#9 stuck for 23s! [kworker/9:53:4131]

Along with that RCU was not able to get scheduled. Which was detected
by RCU stall detector:

OK.
Let's move on then.
