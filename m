I will do it, although I do cling to the hope that others will help.

I'll do it within the next two or three days, unless others beat me to it.

That's always the question about testing, isn't it?

In fact, now that you mention it, why haven't these patches been tested 
yet on every possible combination of OMAP SoC and console UART?  
Unbelievable, how negligent people are.

Yes.  I'll follow up with a pull request (or revisions) after I've tested 
them on some OMAP2 and OMAP4 boards.
