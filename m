How do you cope with the OMAP DMA hardware clearing its FIFO when you
pause it?

The problem is that on mem-to-device transfers, the DMA hardware can
prefetch some data from memory into its FIFO before the device wants
the data.  If you then disable the channel, the hardware clears the
FIFO.

It is unspecified whether the hardware updates the source address in
this case, or by how much.  So it's pretty hard to undo the prefetching
in software.

The net result is: data loss.

This is why I explicitly did not implement pause/resume for non-cyclic
channels.
