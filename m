To show it's possible, I did really hacky proof of concept, hard-coded
to UART3 console for n900/beagle, but at least it shows that this
approach can work, and the module-level wakeups are working and can be
used as the trigger for UART wakeup instead of resume_from_idle.  Of
course, it still has problems with using serial after non-UART wakeups,
but once omap-serial is using runtime PM, that will no longer be an
issue.

My hacky branch is called pm-wip/uart-wkup and is in my pm git tree[1]
(based at the pm-core branch)

To test module-level wakeups (instead of IO-ring) I again forced CORE t=
o
stay on during suspend, and tested wakeup from suspend on 3430/n900:

  echo 3 > /debug/pm_debug/core_pwrdm/suspend
  echo mem > /sys/power/state
