Thanks!

Sorry for not doing this before submitting. Will send the followup soon.

I have put the line discipline code into the machine driver for two reasons:
1. For me, the actual code is much more machine than codec specific.
2. It was much easier to update the codec structure instance with 
machine's provided hw_write() rather than fiddle with adding a new 
member to the structure definition for passing a machine callback to the 
line discipline functions.

If you think we can find any use cases for drivers supporting 
codec/modem combination other than CX20442 on Amstrad Delta, I can agree 
with you on moving the line discipline code out of the machine driver, 
but instead of pushing it down to the codec I would rather se it as a 
separate module.  Anyway, I think that some kind of support on the ASoC 
top level for this case could be helpfull.

I'll add a few words to the followup.

Thanks,
Janusz
