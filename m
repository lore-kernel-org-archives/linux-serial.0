Just to check, do you hook that in your inb/outb/etc?

Generally, it would seem nicer if we could have higher-level
isa_{inb,outb,whatever} accessors that we could hook separately from
other IO.

We don't necessarily have to move all ISA drivers over to that if we had
a separate symbol for that interface.

Thanks,
