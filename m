Sorry, too many mails... The stm32 one is GPL-2.0, as parts of it were
derived from a U-Boot fork. (Personally I prefer GPL-2.0+; fm4 and
xmc4000 are MIT/X11.)

You're free to use any bootloader you like, but you will find it
difficult to build in USB etc. drivers given the sheer size of U-Boot.
That was my motivation for writing the tiny one. ;)

Thanks, I've updated the xmc4000 one accordingly and can do the same fo=
r
stm32. But you are right that I consider that an ugly workaround,
although on the other hand my earlyprintk patches also depend on the
bootloader setting up GPIOs and UART.
