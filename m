In this first version, the reset driver was really generic, and was
compatible with the STM32 family.
The only difference would have been in the device trees.

Now, from the discussion with Philipp, I will reconsider the
implementation to add some named constants,
so maybe I will reconsider the compatible, it will depend on how I
will implement it.

Thanks,
Maxime
