That's interesting! We do have AM437x suspend/resume working without
this workaround (UARTs on AM437x does not use DMA) and UART IPs clkctrl
do go to idle state. Seems like a OMAP4 specific issue.

Comment in omap8250_update_scr() warns not to set these two bits in a
single register write because this may lead to malfunction. I would
recommend to split this into two writes.
