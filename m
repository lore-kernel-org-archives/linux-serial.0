True. I missed that point while doing the testing. Sorry for that.
I further looked into it and saw some two options  in my minicom 
settings(Hardware Flow Control/ Software Flow Control) Which I am 
thinking are the ones used to enable the flow control ? and they are 
both set to NO.

I already enable software flow control and did the testing on beagle, 
where things are working fine
after off mode.
But if I enable hardware flow control, the teraterm does not allow me to 
load my fs and uImage from mmc.
If you have any pointers on how to test hardware flow control, I will 
like to do that on my beagle board.

Thanks,
Sourav
