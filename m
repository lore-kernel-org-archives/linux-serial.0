Better, if a tad verbose.  I guess no one will miss that. :)

Try searching for the "[PATCH 11/11] ASoC: omap-pcm: Convert to use
dmaengine" thread, which was the initial round of patches converting
omap-pcm to DMA engine, and where there was some discussion of how
to handle it at that time.

The result of that was it was felt that the safest approach was to
limit it to cyclic transfers for ASoC, and to use the method which
had been well proven over previous years/decade on numerous different
OMAP hardware.

It's all entirely sensible given that omap-dma has to cope with many
different hardware revisions with two major hardware versions and
people having limited testing resources for validation.  So you will
understand, given the data loss issues here, why it was decided that
omap-dma will only provide pause/resume support for cases where it
has been proven to work sufficiently well and where data loss is not
that a major issue (if a few samples of audio get lost over a
suspend/resume, it's not going to corrupt your data.)
