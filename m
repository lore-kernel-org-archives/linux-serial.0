Unfortunately, I have nothing I can give you at the moment. I am doing
some experiments. Before going further, I need to have the interface
with the kernel accepted.

Of course, I can give more details about the experiments I am doing.
First of all, I am not used to ISO7816 so every feedback are
appreciated.

On the userspace part, there is the PCSC Lite library. It needs a
userspace driver. From what I've seen, most of the readers are managed
by the CCID driver. This driver handle different hardware capabilities.
Some hardware are very close to what we provide with our SoC ie. just
sending the data on the line and not manage the procedure bytes.

The CCID driver includes a lot of things related to the ISO7816 protocol
so I tried to plug my code into it to reuse this code. The issue is that I am
not a CCID device. At the moment, I am writing my own PCSC driver and I am
copying/pasting code I need. The USART only manages the CLK and I/O
signals. Others one are handled by the PCSC driver with the help of
GPIOs.

At a time, I was thinking about a CCID driver (which interprets the CCID
header and interacts with the device handling ISO7816) in the kernel to easily
interface with the PCSC CCID driver but I am not sure it's the right way
to go.

Ludovic
