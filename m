A new workaround is used that reduces the number of interrupts to normal.  
The commit messages are improved since we have a better idea of what was 
wrong.  There is also a new patch (patch 3) for a power management 
regression in the driver.

That's fine, if that's your preference.  It will be several patches, 
though.  And about 75% of the previous series would be reverted, since a 
different workaround would be used.

Let me know if that is indeed what you'd like.
