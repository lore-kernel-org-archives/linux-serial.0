Okay.

That would be okay. Though, in theory Nokia could have different
products with bcm2048 all with different versions.

I was going with defining it as a board level compatible string. Even
if chips are the same, s/w can need to know board level differences so
using the board vendor and name are common.

When? If the interrupt is level triggered, then you can get the line
state based on whether you get an interrupt or not. If this needs to
be a wakeup source (see the wakeup source binding), then it needs to
be an interrupt.

Reading the line state is a common problem. It would be nice if the
irq API provided a function to read the line state though that is not
always possible.

But that is in the 8250 binding. It needs to be a common binding.
