Okay fine exploring this option, right API's would be to use
pm_runtime_forbid/allow.

But to either use runtime forbid or disable we have ensure that
power_domain hooks don't go ahead and disable
the clocks with omap_device_idle as *runtime forbid or disable will
not set runtime_status to RPM_SUSPENDED*
and will stay in RPM_ACTIVE if we call runtime disable or forbid from
active state.

in power_domain hooks we just check the pm_runtime_status_suspended
this will be false even if
we do runtime disable/forbid and it will cut uart clocks always.

So we may need below check also:
