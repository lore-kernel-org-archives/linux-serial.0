Maybe I have not followed well so let's roll back to your previous
comment...

"we need to associate a bus address with a logical Linux port number,
both in of_address_to_resource and in inb()/outb()"

Actually of_address_to_resource() returns the port number to used
in inb/outb(); inb() and outb() add the port number to PCI_IOBASE
to rd/wr to the right virtual address.

Our LPC cannot operate on the virtual address and it operates on
a bus address range that for LPC is also equal to the cpu address
range and goes from 0 to 0x1000.

Now as I understand it is risky and not appropriate to reserve
the logical port numbers from 0 to 0x1000 or to whatever other
upper bound because existing systems may rely on these port numbers
retrieved by __of_address_to_resource().

In this scenario I think the best thing to do would be
in the probe function of the LPC driver:
1) call pci_register_io_range() passing [0, 0x1000] (that is the
   range for LPC)
2) retrieve the logical port numbers associated to the LPC range
   by calling pci_address_to_pio() for 0 and 0x1000 and assign
   them to extio_ops_node->start and extio_ops_node->end
3) implement the LPC accessors to operate on the logical ports
   associated to the LPC range (in practice in the accessors
   implementation we will call pci_pio_to_address to retrieve
   the cpu address to operate on)

What do you think?

Thanks
