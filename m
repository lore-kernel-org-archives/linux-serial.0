Thanks, I got it.

After referring to arm64 and risc-v, we try to refine our code, such as
removing unneeded checking and refining syscall restart flow. We
hope these modifications can enhance the reliability and readability.
However, the following 2 files which you had acked are included in
this modification.
1. arch/nds32/include/asm/nds32.h
    (patch: Assembly macros and definitions)
     The definition of  macro tbl and why are removed.
       - Now, we use pt_reg->syscallno instead of 'why' to determine
         whether entering kernel is via syscall or not. Therefore, macro
         'why' is unneeded.

2. arch/nds32/kernel/ex-scall.S    (patch: System calls handling)
    a. Define macro tbl
        - The marco tbl is used only in this file. So, I move its definition
          from arch/nds32/include/asm/nds32.h to here.
    b. Remove 'set why = 0'  when issuing syscall number is invalid
    c. Adjust input arguments of syscall_trace_enter

If you think these modifications in acked files are not permitted,
we will recover it.

We verify all modifications by LTP 2017 related cases and glibc
2.26 testsuite. We plan to add it in the next version patch and
hope you can give us some comments as before.

Thanks

Vincent
