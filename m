Thank you for your suggestion.
I will update it like this.

        prompt "minimum CPU type"
        default CPU_V3
        help
          The data cache of N15/D15 is implemented as PIPT and it will not cause
          the cache aliasing issue. The rest cpus(N13, N10 and D10) are
          implemented as VIPT data cache. It may cause the cache aliasing issue
          if its cache way size is larger than page size. You can specify the
          CPU type direcly or choose CPU_V3 if unsure.

          A kernel built for N10 is able to run on N15, D15, N13, N10 or D10.
          A kernel built for N15 is able to run on N15 or D15.
          A kernel built for D10 is able to run on D10 or D15.
          A kernel built for D15 is able to run on D15.
          A kernel built for N13 is able to run on N15, N13 or D15.
