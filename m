Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for the report.

The "too much work" message means serial8250_handle_irq() is returning 0,
ie., not handled. Which in turn means IIR indicates no interrupt is pending
(UART_IIR_NO_INT == 1).

Can you log the register values for LSR and IIR at both patch locations
in serial8250_do_startup()?

(I can get you a debug patch, if necessary. Let me know)
