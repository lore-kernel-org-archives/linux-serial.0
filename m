The important part is to not merge a user space interface into the upstream
kernel that we still want to change. It's clear that it takes some time to
update gdb and other programs using the ptrace interface, so I'd suggest
to simply not have any ptrace interface submitted for inclusion until that
is complete.

In the meantime, you can keep the existing version as an add-on kernel
patch, you probably have other patches that are not ready to get merged
yet, so just keep this one in the same tree as the others.
