This is an excellent point. The handling of the watchdogs needs to be
more carefully considered/placed.

I am open to looking at implementing a fair prb_cpulock(). I think
without it, your observation for these "multi-CPU emergency message
flood" cases is correct.

If the prb_cpulock() is fair, they are both taking turns printing. The
prb_cpulock() is taken for _each_ printk() call and not (like in the
current printk) for the complete unprinted contents of the ringbuffer.

Yes, because it is assumed that emergency messages will never occur for
a correctly running system. We've run tests where we pr_info() from all
contexts and the console_loglevel is set such that KERN_INFO is printed
to the console. The storage of the messages into the printk ringbuffer
do not cause any unacceptable latencies. And printing those messages to
the consoles via the fully preemptible printk-kthread also causes no
unacceptable latencies.

Obviously as soon as any emergency message appears, an _unacceptable_
latency occurs. But that is considered OK because the system is no
longer running correctly and it is worth the price to pay to get those
messages with such high reliability.

In a previous response[0] to Petr, I talk about defining _all_ console
printing as emergency and requiring userspace to handle informational
messages. With that definition, one could argue that the atomic consoles
are enough and we could avoid the printk-kthread(s) altogether. I am not
absolutely against this idea. But there (most likely) will be consoles
that cannot support atomic. And how should they be handled? We could
keep the current (quite complex) implementation in place just for
them. But I really wonder if all that is necessary just for those (few?)
consoles. printk-kthreads seem to me to be the ideal solution
(particularly when dealing with PREEMPT_RT, where nearly everything
important becomes a kthread). My RFC series implements a very simple
(naive) approach to kthread printing. I believe there is a lot[1][2] we
can do to make the printk-kthread printing more reliable.
