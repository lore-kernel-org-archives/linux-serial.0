flush_to_ldisc calls into the tty core code which sleeps. The rule is
that you may not call flush_to_ldisc except from a workqueue context.

If you break that rule then various bad things will occur (eg rx ->
flush_to_ldisc -> n_tty -> flow control -> tx -> deadlock) in a lot of
drivers.

Several of them are ones that shouldn't.
