yes, I think that would be best.

Right, makes sense.

It's correct on openrisc, because that has a reliable cycle counter,
and that gets used in its delay function:

void __delay(unsigned long cycles)
{
        cycles_t start = get_cycles();
        while ((get_cycles() - start) < cycles)
                cpu_relax();
}

In my review comment that you cited, I assumed that nds32 had similar
hardware.

However, as you explained earlier, the nds32 architecture does not provide
a cycle counter and the clocksource resolution is not high enough to
be a good replacement, so you have to use the traditional delay
calibration.
