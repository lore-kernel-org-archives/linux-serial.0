This is masking behavior changes behind what is essentially a refactor.
For example, here's Felipe's changelog to omap-serial:

commit d044d2356f8dd18c755e13f34318bc03ef9c6887
Author: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 23 09:58:33 2014 -0500

    tty: serial: omap: switch over to devm_ioremap_resource
    
    just using helper function to remove some duplicated
    code a bit. While at that, also move allocation of
    struct uart_omap_port higher in the code so that
    we return much earlier in case of no memory.

No mention of correcting an error return value here.

Why change the error return from probe() now?

Before you say consistency, I think you should look at the stats below.
IOW, if you want to change the error code return from probe() for
consistency's sake, a tree-wide patch would be the appropriate way.

Ok, not 'none' but hardly tree-wide.

And of those 10 drivers now using devm_ioremap_resource(),
3 drivers still return ENODEV for a missing resource [1]. (FWIW, I wrote 'none'
on the basis of a grep of devm_ioremap_resource and looking at the last one,
serial-tegra.c, which has exactly the construct objected to in the Spreadtrum
driver).

Another 9 drivers still use plain devm_ioremap(), even those with
trivial conversions like samsung.c [2]

Of the serial drivers which use platform_get_resource(),
10 return  ENODEV
5  return  EINVAL (not including those converted to devm_ioremap_resource())
4  return  ENXIO
3  return  ENOMEM
2  return  ENOENT
1  returns EBUSY
1  returns EFAULT

So to recap, I see no reason to respin this driver submission when:
1. even drivers already using devm_ioremap_resource() aren't consistent
2. drivers which could trivially use devm_ioremap_resource, don't
3. there's no basis for requiring consistent return value _yet_
   (or even what that value should be)
4. the platform_get_resource()/devm_ioremap_resource is an awkward code construct
