Yes true, for suspend path but for Idle path we don't have any such
mechanism.

Its not necessary which driver we use, its about clock handling mechani=
sm
where it has to be done.

if we add clock handling mechanism into the driver, from driver context
handling clocks + managing the printks for the same uart port is a
issue, due to reasons said earlier.

IIUC ->prepare and -> complete are only for suspend path
when we do system wide suspend

for normal idle path get_sync and put_sycn we dont have any ->prepare
or -> complete where we can buffer the contents and flush later.

I have done clock gating in idle path integrating irq chaining patches.
hosted in gitorious here[1].

Was consolidating whether this approach is OK,
or
Are there any other approaches that I should consider?
