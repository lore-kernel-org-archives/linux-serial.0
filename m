There is indeed an argument here.  The decision of how to act in this 
situation needs to be up to the user of the serial port.

The default behavior needs to be what you state: to not lose characters.  
And indeed that is what it is in v3.3: the UART will not enter idle when 
the PM runtime autosuspend timeout is -1.  

But in cases where there is a protocol that can handle retries, the system 
integrator may well prefer the large power savings available by letting 
the chip enter device idle, and take the added delay in the retransmission 
process.

As in many power management situations, the choice needs to be up to the 
user of the serial port or the system administrator, with the default 
mode being to not lose data.  We must not remove that choice from them, 
otherwise they will just hack it in later.
