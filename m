This doesn't apply to my tty-next branch:
	checking file drivers/tty/serial/omap-serial.c
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 40.
	Hunk #2 succeeded at 162 (offset 6 lines).
	Hunk #3 succeeded at 280 (offset 5 lines).
	Hunk #4 succeeded at 378 (offset 6 lines).
	Hunk #5 succeeded at 1312 (offset 8 lines).
	Hunk #6 succeeded at 1405 (offset 8 lines).
	Hunk #7 succeeded at 1528 (offset 10 lines).
	Hunk #8 FAILED at 1638.
	Hunk #9 succeeded at 1705 (offset 6 lines).
	2 out of 9 hunks FAILED

so I can't apply it, sorry.
