Sorry about the breakage.  I agree with the diagnosis.  That code was just=
=20
copied from the DMA errata part of the driver, so it will need to be fixed=
=20
as well.  Otherwise the same problem will happen when DMA is enabled.

That's really the key question for the medium- to long-term...

Looks fine to me, although I'd suggest fixing the DMA workaround path as=20
well.
