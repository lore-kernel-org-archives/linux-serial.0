This patch series applied on top of pm-core branch

commit 4c1f85cdc189d41ee53c1bc3957a908c91cffc00
Merge: ca1684b 96c4e27
Author: Kevin Hilman <khilman@deeprootsystems.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 16 15:29:06 2010 -0700

with below changes:

1) if (uart->timeout)
                uart->timeout =3D (30 * HZ);

2) #define DEFAULT_TIMEOUT 5 [temporary change for timeout]

I see ret count getting incremented on ZOOM3 even without "UART4 support
to omap_uart_idle_init()" patch.

I dont see any crash.
