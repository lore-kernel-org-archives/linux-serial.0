That's what I saw too; almost all the dma drivers are broken wrt x_char.
The amba-pl011 driver gets it right.

'High' priority is meant relative to previously written data which has
not yet been sent.

'Better' would be sending the x_char when the current dma transfer
completes. However, it will probably have /some/ impact on what line
rates software flow control can be used. Worst case @ 115Kbaud is 35ms
delay in sending.

'Best' would be pausing the dma and sending the byte. However, I'm not
even sure if this is possible on OMAP; the TRM is woefully under-documented
in that regard.

I agree; this is what we should do first because someone might want it
for backports.
