It will try, but note that current code takes the console_lock() during
that time, so those prints will be buffered.

I'm not sure why you're calling this "enable back clocks."  This patch
is just trying to decide where to idle the hwmod (that is, disable the
clocks.)

Re: only the driver can do it, I can think of at least 2 ways to keep
this out of the driver.

1) Use the a custom activate_func in the omap_device pm_lats struct
   to idle the first time.

2) Use a bus notifier so the device init can be notified when the
   real driver is available.  I think you're probably wanting
   the BUS_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER event, which would happen right
   before probe.  There's also BUS_NOTIFY_BOUND_DRIVER which
   happens right after probe.   You might actually want to use
   both.  e.g.   console_lock(); omap_hwmod_idle() in BIND
   and console_unlock() in 'BOUND'.

Yes, I saw that in the patch, and that's what I don't like.

=46ixing up after earlyprintk is not the responsiblity of the driver, a=
nd
the driver should not know or care whether earlyprintk was or wasn't
used before it was loaded.  This needs to be handled in device init cod=
e
as it is today.
