OK yeah this is the case I was seeing too. So do you just set the
LED triggers to none in sysfs to make it easier to reproduce?

This I don't think I've seen. This could also be the errata issue on
your earlier rev beagleboard-xm with off-idle.

I wonder if doing some TX on the uart restores it? So maybe try

$ while [ 1 ]; do date; sleep 10 done &

To have it occasionally print something in the background.
