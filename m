Hi,

I have noticed that the serial console on my ia64 machine seems
to have broken since 2.6.16. Thanks to git bisect I have been
able to track this problem down to 111c9bf8c5cfa92363b3719c8956d29368b5b9de

  [SERIAL] remove 8250_acpi (replaced by 8250_pnp and PNPACPI)

  With the combination of PNPACPI and 8250_pnp, we no longer need
  8250_acpi.

I haven't had time to look into the code and I have to leave
my desk shortly, so I thought I would post here to see if anyone
has any ideas.

I am boot using the following command line:

  console=tty0 console=uart,io,0x2f8 console=ttyS0

Althogh I'm pretty sure I really only need:

  console=uart,io,0x2f8

A failed boot looks like this:

  io scheduler anticipatory registered (default)
  Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 4 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
  isa bounce pool size: 16 pages
  RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 4096K size 1024 blocksize
  mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
  EFI Variables Facility v0.08 2004-May-17
  No ttyS device at I/O port 0x2f8 for console

And a successful boot looks like this:

  io scheduler anticipatory registered (default)
  Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 4 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
  acpi_serial_port: zero-length IO port range?
  serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 44) is a 16550A
  acpi_serial_port: zero-length IO port range?
  serial8250: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 45) is a 16550A
  isa bounce pool size: 16 pages
  RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 4096K size 1024 blocksize
  mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
  EFI Variables Facility v0.08 2004-May-17
  Adding console on ttyS1 at I/O port 0x2f8 (options '115200')

The machine in question is a Trus64-21. Sorry I don't have an English
link handy, but if you need me to dig up details please ask.
