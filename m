OK, so what *I'm learning* from this bug report:

10) WARN/ERR messages do not necessarily tell us that the stability of the
    system was jeopardized. The system can "run correctly" and be
    "perfectly healthy".

20) We can have N CPUs reporting issues simultaneously. Even in production.
    Such patterns exist in the kernel.

30) The "reporting part" - printk()->call_console_drivers() - can be the
    slowest one.

  In this particular case, given that Mikulas saw dropped messages,
  checksum calculation was significantly faster than call_console_drivers().
  Now, suppose we have new printk, and suppose we have CPUs A B C D, each of
  them reports a checksum error:

  A prb_lock owner    B prb_lock    C prb_lock    D prb_lock

  A calls call_console_drivers, unlocks prb_lock
  B grabs prb_lock
  B calls call_console_drivers
  A calculates new checksum mismatch
  A calls printk and spins on prb_lock, behind D

  So now we have:

  B prb_lock owner    C prb_lock    D prb_lock    A prb_lock

  And so on

  B C D A  ->  C D A B  ->  D A B C  ->  A B C D  ->  ...

  After M rounds of error reporting (M > N), each CPU, had have to busy
  wait M times (N - 1). Sounds quadratic.

40) goto 10

So I have some doubts regarding some of assumptions behind new printk
design. And the problem is not in prb_lock() unfairness. Current printk
design does look to me SMP-friendly; yes, it has unbound printing loop;
that can be addressed. But it doesn't turn SMP system into UP.
