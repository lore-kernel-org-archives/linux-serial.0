Right, we wouldn't call acpi_pci_probe_root_resources() for LPC,
the change is just that we always pass the fwnode pointer to allow
matching based on that for any I/O space that does not have a
physical memory address associated with it.

I tried to keep this part general, so in theory that allows us to
have more than one I/O space without a CPU mapping, even though
we don't strictly need that for supporting your LPC controller.

Right, sorry about that, I forgot to commit this bugfix before looking
at the I/O space stuff.

You are right, I got the wrong place. The parent node will have 
a #address-cells but won't have ranges for the I/O space.

I think this part is completely safe, I can't imagine why you'd
have more than one range of I/O ports that have valid translations.

Do you have a specific example in mind where that would not be
the case, or are you just worried about the principle in general?

Agreed.

I think we don't need to limit the EXTIO range at all. For your
specific case of LPC, we know it is limited, but my prototype
patch leaves this part generic enough to also allow using it
for a PCI host with indirect I/O space, and that can have a larger
size.

Good point. We normally call pci_register_io_range() from
of_pci_range_to_resource and its ACPI equivalent.

When there is no ranges, we obviously won't call it, but there is
also no size associated with it. I think this is ok because
the host driver would already know the size based on the hardware
register layout, and it can just register that directly.

> 2) For PCI MMIO, I think 'addr' is needed

So far I assumed it was, but actually we can perhaps remove
the address if we manage to kill off pci_address_to_pio()
and pci_pio_to_address.

I'm not completely sure I'm following here. Generally speaking, addresses
below PCIBIOS_MIN_IO are intended for PCI-ISA bridges and PCI devices with
hardcoded port numbers for ISA compatibility, while __pci_assign_resource
is meant to do dynamic assignment of I/O resources above PCIBIOS_MIN_IO
so it does not conflict with the legacy ISA ports.

Does that address your concern?

I think it would be a good idea to enforce page-alignment here, even
though everything could still work if it's not page-aligned.

The requirement for ioremap_page_range() is that the offset within
a page must be the same for the virtual and physical addresses.

Adding page-alignment to pci_register_io_range() could be an enhancement
that we can do independent of the other patches.

Thanks a lot for your detailed analysis and feedback.
