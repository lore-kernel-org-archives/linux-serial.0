However the default autosuspend_delay_ms is "-1", not "0", and "-1" does
disable runbtime_pm completely.  It increments usage_count (see
update_autosuspend()) so runtime_pm can never suspend the device.

Maybe it is 37xx specific.  I think this is a DM3730.

Hmm... I thought it was the other way around - CLKEN could gate the clock
off, and PRCM could also turn it off after a handshake.  But I finally found
the relevant text:

   The software effect is immediate and direct. The functional clock is
   turned on as soon as the bit is set, and turned off if the bit is cleared
   and the clock is not required by any module.

so it seems I was wrong.

Still - something is definitely going wrong because I definitely an regular=
ly
see garbage characters.  And the patch fixes it.  So some runtime-suspend
handler must be doing something bad, and it must happen while characters
are being written.

If you pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(), the suspend won't happen immediately b=
ut
will wait the timeout.
If you pm_runtime_put_sync(), the suspend happens straight away.
If you pm_runtime_put(), the suspend is schedule immediately in another
thread, so it happens very soon.  It doesn't wait for a timer to expire (no
timer is ticking at this point).

Just because an autosuspend timeout was set earlier, that won't cause
pm_runtime_put() to delay in suspending the device when it is called.

So I think it does request that the clocks be turned off immediately.

My TRM saids that SYSC for the UARTs doesn't have CLOCKACTIVITY. Only
 AUTOIDLE SOFTRESET ENAWAKEUP IDLEMODE

Is it worth trying anyway?

But not when it is -1.

Yes, leaving autosuspend_delay_ms at the default of -1 .... :-)

Yes, I'd begun to realise that - thanks.

Both. With clocks kept on (autosuspend =3D=3D -1) I'm using about 30 mA mor=
e than
before.  With clocks allowed to go off it is closer to 40mA more !!! Weird,
isn't it?

     -1.

I was thinking the auto-suspend would kick in - but I had it backwards it
seems.  I'll have to rethink things.
(yes, UART3).

Thanks for your time.
I'm going to have to come up with a better theory for why my patch works.

Thanks,
