Hi, Arnd:

Maybe we should keep the original implementation for this reason.
The default value of CPU_CACHE_NONALIASING and ANDES_PAGE_SIZE_8KB is
available for all CPU types for now.
User can use these configs built kernel to boot on almost all nds32 CPUs.

It might be a little bit weird if we config CPU_N10 but run on a N13 CPU.
This might confuse our users.
