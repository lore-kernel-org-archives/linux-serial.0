pm-wip uart branch is having all the mach-omap2/serail.c changes along with
hwmod data file updation and serial hwmod usage.

The driver patch [serial: Add OMAP high-speed UART driver]
was tested against wip/uart branch.

I will re-base all these patches for-next branch,
and will post driver and board support patches from pm-wip/uart as a
single series.
