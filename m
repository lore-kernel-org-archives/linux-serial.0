In theory, you might want to wake up a device to perform some very 
limited operation (like reading an internal register) and then put it 
back into suspend very quickly, without waiting for the autosuspend 
delay to elapse.  Apart from that, I can't think of any reason not to 
update last_busy in rpm_resume.
