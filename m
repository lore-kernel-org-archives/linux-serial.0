Oh the 8250 normally works this way?  I didn't know that.

You can dma more than the fifo size?

Well if DMA takes care of it, and the normal 8250 is already like this,
then I suppose it is already better than the typical case.

All? or just every 4 (that's what I just read in the DRA7xx docs).

That's nice of it.  I will have to give this a try.
