And case 2) is somewhat useless as it requires the uart to be
clocked.

OK at least for am335x/am437x, changing it's mode between gpio and
uart use can be done with pinctrl framework with named pinctrl
named modes.

Yes that's needed for am335x and am437x to get a wake-up event from
rx pin for example. Not needed for omap3/4/5.

Hmm but it seems we already have that working for 8250_omap for
omap3/4/5 where rx pin provides wakeup events when 8250_omap is
in runtime suspend state. See the dev_pm_set_dedicated_wake_irq()
parts in 8250_omap.c. For am335x/am437x I think the only thing
missing is toggling between uart and gpio mode for the rx pin
using pinctrl named modes. There's an example for am335x in
omap_hsmmc.c with pinctrl_pm_select_idle_state() if that helps.

But maybe you have something in case 3) that I don't follow?

I think it's needed in the DT gpio interrupt case as some
gpio controllers need to configure edge vs level.
