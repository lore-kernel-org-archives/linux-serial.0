This patch is basically fine from an ASoC point of view so I've applied
it.

You'll want to run checkpatch over it and send a followup fixing the
issues it identifies.  Looking at this I suspect that it may be possible
to refactor things so that more of the line discipline interaction is
pushed down into the CODEC driver but that can also be done as a
followup.

Since this (and all the other descriptive text that follows it):

...is useful documentation I've pulled it into the commit message.  It
would also be nice to add some documentation somewhere explaining how
the hw_write() function is expected to be set up since it's a little
surprising (if the line discipline stuff were pushed down into the code
that'd become a lot more obvious).
