I'm pretty sure that current configuration of UART indeed sets Rx FIFO
threshold to
1 character, as opposite to 16 characters mentioned in comments. Kernel 3.3
is the origin of Rx 1-char-granularity bit setting, but states clearly
that Rx FIFO
is being set to 1 character in non-DMA mode. The comment appears between
3.6 and 3.7 in commit 6721ab7f77f2614ab43e3de2f908b1d7436331df by Felipe Balbi.
3.0-3.2 kernels don't have 1-char-granularity enabled, and Rx FIFO
threshold level
was effectively set to 16 characters, what should be the same as my
patch that turned off
1-char-granularity

Paul, can you confirm (if possible, surely) if 3.0-3.2 kernels had same issue?

Felipe, it would be great to get your comments on this?
