Useful and interesting - thanks.
However what it really shows me is that I was misunderstanding the code
(If I spent the time to verify every conclusion that I jumped to, I'd never
get anywhere :-( ).  Better clarify that now.

So this function - serial_omap_tx_empty() is called to test if the
tx queue is empty.

It is called in a loop at the end of uart_wait_until_sent.

uart_wait_until_sent it calls from various places, but particularly when
doing an 'stty' ioctl.

The loop isn't a very tight loop though it would be tighter if jiffies were
smaller.  As it is it checks every jiffy and usually loops 3 times when I
see corruption.

So when I

   cat somefile

to the serial console, most of the file comes out fine.  But after 'cat'
finishes and returns to the shell - while some chars are still in the FIFO =
-=20
the shell does an 'stty' ioctl to make sure the settings are still OK.
This ioctl calls serial_omap_tx_empty which calls pm_resume_put() which
immediately suspends the uart, which seems to stop some clock - even though
we think it shouldn't.

(If is use 'dash' instead of 'bash', that shell doesn't fiddle with stty, a=
nd
I don't see any corruption).

After a bit more experimentation, I find that if either UART3 or UART4 (whi=
ch
are numbers 2 and 3 is sysfs!!!) have auto_suspend_delay set to -1, then I
don't see any corruption.
But if both are set to 5000, then I do.

(The settings of UART1 and UART2 seem to be irrelevant - presumably because
they are in CORE, not PER).

So if either uart wants PER_48M_FCLK on, then it stays on.  But if neither
explicitly request it and are only keeping it on by being active ... then
there is room for a hiccup it seems.
Or maybe it isn't the clocks ... maybe the problem is that PER goes into
RET mode, which it does for about 40msec.

If I run
 cat /sys/kernel/debug/pm_debug/time; stty 115200; \
 cat /sys/kernel/debug/pm_debug/time

then I see corruption near the end of the first output of the 'time' file,
and the time that PER is in RET goes up by about 40msec.
This could be because the clock goes off, or maybe it has some other cause
that I'm not aware of.

So yeah - I was quite wrong in my original analysis, thanks for encouraging
me to sort it out.



This is awfully similar to the problem I had with HDQ - clock seeming to
disappear when it should not.

There is something important I'm missing.... time to go back to the TRM I
guess..

I'll do that, thanks.
