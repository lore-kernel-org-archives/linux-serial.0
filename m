I've used LogicPD Torpedo Wireless SoM + DevKit board. Bootloader is
stock from their BSP, u-boot 2011.06 + patches from LogicPD.
I can provide dmesg of 3.8(inital kernel this patch was intented for)
a bit later during the day, and a bit more later same patch rebased
onto latest sources.
Also, I should mention that LogicPD does not support 3.8, so most
LogicPD-specific devices are not working.

And I'd like to point out that after patch gaps I've seen are not gone
completely, ~1 packet out of 200 at 1mbaud is still corrupted, but
only when PM is enabled in kernel,
what gives me a clue that it must be something in PM also. Maybe my
patch just reveals PM-specific issue. Have you tried without PM to
reproduce issues you're experiencing?

Indeed, TRMs appear to contain wrong information, but I believe that
in this particular case, bug is somewhere around, but not in these
lines.
I believe if you take a look on related TRM pages, it seems quite
logical that configuration of SCR (before my patch) is not quite
proper:
 - trigger interrupt only when it's entirely empty, not when threshold
level is reached, what is incorrect, in my opinion.
 - (less influencing) Granularity of counter indicates opposite to
what is stated in comments

These issues may have never been experienced by others, since
originally I've hit them on 1mbaud speed, what is not supported by
original driver at all.

Sorry, I've missed that file at all. After patch I've never expericed
any issues on 115200 speed of debug console, and it works flawlessly
for me.
