I see. So we must still ensure that the ISA driver either gets loaded
before the PCI driver, or never. It is already closely coupled with
the PNP driver, but I think we can still get to the point where you
don't load the ISA driver at all if you only have platform 8250
ports that are not supposed to be reconfigurable.

On most non-x86 machines, I would think we also want a way to build
the PCI driver without that dependency.
