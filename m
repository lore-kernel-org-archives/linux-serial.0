I think it really depends on how much flexibility you want to give to users.
The way I suggested first was to allow selecting an arbitrary combination
of CPUs, and then let Kconfig derive the correct set of optimization flags
and other options that work with those. That is probably the easiest for
the users, but can be tricky to get right for all combinations.

When you put them in a sorted list like I mentioned for simplicity, you
could reduce the confusion by naming them differently, e.g.
CONFIG_CPU_N10_OR_NEWER.

Having only the CPU_CACHE_NONALIASING option is fine if you
never need to make any other decisions based on the CPU core
type, but then the help text should describe specifically which cases
are affected (N10/N13/D13 with 4K page size), and you can decide to
hide the option and make it always-on when using 8K page size.
