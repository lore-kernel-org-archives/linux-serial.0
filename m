This is not directly hwmod related,

A period is missing. Or maybe it should a comma with not capital letter.

Why do we have to idle -> enable? The module is already enabled, isn't it?
The comment is not super clear for me :-)
Is the goal is to reset the IP?

I do not understand that part to?
This is not the default, but instead a specific one only for the serial driver.

It looks to me that you are overwriting the default one with a specific one.

That's looks like a hack to me to add that specific serial hooks into the core code.
But I'm not sure to have any better idea, since the issue is the lack of function pointer in DT :-)

> +	od = omap_device_alloc(pdev, hwmods, oh_cnt, pm_lat, 0);

It should not be 0 but the size of the array here: ARRAY_SIZE(omap_console_latency).

I'm wondering how it can work with zero since the code is doing that in omap_device_alloc:

od->pm_lats = kmemdup(pm_lats,
		      sizeof(struct omap_device_pm_latency) * pm_lats_cnt,
		      GFP_KERNEL);

Benoit
