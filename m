One correction on this part...

It just occurred to me that, supposedly, the only UART input line that is 
attached to the SWAKEUP signal is CTS.  So the UART may not in fact be 
able to deassert its idle-ack autonomously at this point.

So you might want to give your clock re-enable after WFI idea a shot!  It 
would be interesting if it helps.

I regret the oversight,
