Also interestingly, specifying console with stdout-path vs. console=xyz leads to a
subtle behaviour change of boot printing.

With console=xyz, console_setup() -> __add_preferred_console() sets
preferred_console = 0, which doesn't happen with stdout-path.

ARC defconfigs have CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE, so tty0 gets registered. For stdout-path
case it becomes default (deregistering the earlycon), but not in case of cconsole=xyz.

This manifests as a "pause" in boot logging (perceivable if u have linux running
in simulation on a slow host or a large initramfs loading etc). printing is
restored when the real 8250 console registers towards end of boot.

One workaround to this seems to be using @keep_bootcon cmdline option. Asking for
all the bells and whistles to be implemented with paramless earlycon is perhaps
not fair :-)

But this is something developers in this area need to be aware of nevertheless.
