In fact we are in the middle of preparing DT and driver patches for ups=
treaming
the out of tree drivers Neil is mentioning. So there are no users *yet*=
 and
maybe we are the first one.

Neil has already completely argued and commented on that topic:

Unfortunately he acked the removal with a completely non-technical argu=
ment:

Now we have the problem that it got kicked out while we were preparing
the other parts :(

On the other hand, please consider that we don=92t have the manpower an=
d knowledge
to modify bigger parts of Linux besides plumbing together parts that al=
ready
exist and add drivers and DT nodes.

So please consider again to re-add 9574f36fb801035f6ab0fbb1b53ce2c12c17=
d100.

Or should we resubmit it together with our DT/drivers where we use it?

BR,
Nikolaus
