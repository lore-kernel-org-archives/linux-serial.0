OK so let's distinguish between two corruption situations:

1. The first character transmitted to the OMAP UART in a serial console=20
when the UART powerdomain is in a non-functional, low power state (e.g.,=20
RET or below) is corrupted.  This is not actually output corruption, this=
=20
is input corruption.

2. Characters are corrupted while the OMAP UART is transmitting data, but=
=20
there has been no recent data sent to the OMAP.

Case 1 is expected and is almost certainly not a bug.  As Neil mentioned=20
it should be bps-rate dependent.  It occurs when the first character=20
transmitted to the OMAP wakes the chip up via I/O ring/chain wakeup.
I/O ring/chain wakeup is driven by a 32KiHz clock and is therefore=20
relatively high-latency.  So this could easily cause the first character=20
or first few characters to be lost or corrupted, depending on the exact=20
sequence of events, the low power state that the chip was in, etc.

Case 2 is not expected.  That is likely a bug somewhere.  Neil, this is=20
what I understood that you are experiencing.  Is that correct?

Gra=C5=BEvydas, are you seeing case 1 or 2 (or something completely differe=
nt=20
;-) ?
