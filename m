Well I guess it's normal resume callback is called during probe as
pm_runtime_get_sync() is called there, and according to documentation
[1], devices are assumed to be suspended before probe is called.

According to [1], pm_runtime_set_active() should be called before
pm_runtime_enable() to indicate to the core that device is active
during probe if that's the case, I guess this means
pm_runtime_get_sync() is not needed in that case, but I'm not sure
what's the actual serial state during probe nowadays.

[1] chapter 5 of Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt:
The initial runtime PM status of all devices is 'suspended', but it
need not reflect the actual physical state of the device. Thus, if the
device is initially active (i.e. it is able to process I/O), its
runtime PM status must be changed to 'active', with the help of
pm_runtime_set_active(), before pm_runtime_enable() is called for the
device.
