I am running Kernel 5.3.2 trying to troubleshoot some intermittent
Bluetooth issues, and I think I have narrowed it down to the serial
driver in use.
By default, omap2plus_defconfig enables both SERIAL_8250_OMAP and
SERIAL_OMAP.  I have my console device configured as  ttyS0, and all
appears fine.  When I enable Bluetooth, however, I get intermittent
errors on an DM3730 / OMAP3630.

Using the 8250 driver for Blueotooth I get intermittent frame errors
and data loss.

(after a fairly long hang, I hit control-c)

However, disabling the 8250 driver and using the only SERIAL_OMAP and
the console routed to ttyO0, the Bluetooth works well, so I believe it
to be a serial driver issue and not a Bluetooth error.

0% loss and regular, repeatable communication without any Frame
reassembly errors.

Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot or what might cause the
difference between the two drivers?
