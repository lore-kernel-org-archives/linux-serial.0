Yes correct so if we go for the single domain solution arch that
have PCIBIOS_MIN_IO=0 cannot support special devices such as LPC
unless we also redefine PCIBIOS_MIN_IO, right?

I am not very on the "generalized" multi-domain solution...
Currently the IO accessors prototypes have an unsigned long addr
as input parameter. If we live in a multi-domain IO system
how can we distinguish inside the accessor which domain addr
belongs to?
