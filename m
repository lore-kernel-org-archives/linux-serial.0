Actually the wakeup happens but control never moves to uart isr
Gets looped for ever in clearing wakeup status in prcm_irq_handler
path.

--> omap2_cm_rmw_mod_reg_bits
     ---> prcm_clear_mod_irqs
          ---> prcm_interrupt_handler

it gets looped here forever.

Yes Correct, here seems to work.

sorry forgot to specify here, to avoid above scenario I am suppressing
complete printk's using sysfs interface.
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
so by applying this patch and booting up and then suppressing printks
then setting uart timeout, after timeout hitting any key.
Similar behavior of always in loop to clear wakeup status.
