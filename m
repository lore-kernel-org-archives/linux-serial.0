They should call omap_serial_init_port to configure each individual uar=
t with
mux_info filled and not use omap_serial_init.

If any board is not dependent for mux from u-boot then they use above s=
aid
init_port func.

No. You need to use either omap_serial_init_port or omap_serial_init
you cannot call both apis from board file please refer to both func
documentation.

Also please note i am not configuring all uart pins for pullups and pul=
l downs
with this patch series and its not related to this patch series.
I am only enabling wakeup-enable pin for rx as it was done before.

Yes that be done but currently but that is not in my intention here
with my patch
I just want to retain rx wakeup by default to avoid breaking support
for any board.

Adding pin mux for each individual pin is a separate activity where I a=
lso
need access to various boards So I am leaving that to developers who
want to configure
for the corresponding boards using init_port api.

Removing mux from u-boot level and adding it to board file is beyond
the scope of this
patch series and is a separate topic of discussion, as current patch se=
ries
assumes that uarts are muxed from u-boot level and needs to only enable=
 wakeup
capability for rx-pin.

Hope this clarifies.
