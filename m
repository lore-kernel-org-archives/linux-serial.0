+ Nilesh from the PRCM design team, I and Vishwa had a short meeting
with Nilesh just to double confirm our understanding on how IO daisy
should be implemented.

I agree the OMAP3 TRM isn't very clear in mentioning this and overall
there is very limited documentation on this.

The OMAP4 TRM however is a little better and there isn't any difference
in the way IO Daisy is implemented in OMAP3 and OMAP4.

So, I'll try and explain what I meant based on whats in the OMAP4 TRM :=
)

I am referring to OMAP4430_ES2.x Public TRM vO.

refer to Figure 3-74. I/O Pads Daisy-Chain Configuration,
The WUEN signal to each pad (which can be used to enable IO-daisy
for the given pad) is a AND of a signal from PRCM and
one from SCM.
The signal from PRCM can be enabled by writing into
PRM_IO_PMCTRL[16] GLOBAL_WUEN bit (which in our case we keep
enabled always, done early at boot).
The signal from SCM can be enabled by writing to the individual
pad registers in SCM
CONTROL.CONTROL_PADCONF_<IOpad>[14] WAKEUPENABLE0
CONTROL.CONTROL_PADCONF_<IOpad>[30] WAKEUPENABLE1.
This is done by hwmod every time the module is enabled/idled.

This is what is mentioned in the TRM here
"The I/O pad wake-up scheme must be enabled (WUEN signal) globally by=20
setting the
PRM_IO_PMCTRL[16] GLOBAL_WUEN bit and by also setting I/O pad wake-up=20
enabled/disabled
individually (WUEN signal) by writing to the following bit fields in th=
e=20
control module:
=95 CONTROL.CONTROL_PADCONF_<IOpad>[14] WAKEUPENABLE0
=95 CONTROL.CONTROL_PADCONF_<IOpad>[30] WAKEUPENABLE1"

And then the TRM mentions this about the need to trigger WUCLKIN
for every pad enable/disable.
This is needed to reset any spurious wakeups events.

"Once configured, the wake-up scheme within each I/O pad is enabled and=
=20
disabled by triggering a control
(WUCLKIN signal) of the I/O daisy chain. This is done thanks to a=20
dedicated PRCM module register bit
PRM_IO_PMCTRL[8] WUCLK_CTRL. The software must enable the I/O wakeup=20
prior entering a
low-power mode and disable it following a wake-up event.
Writing the PRM_IO_PMCTRL[8] WUCLK_CTRL bit to 1 asserts signal WUCLKIN=
=20
high to reset spurious
wake-up event and to latch the current pad input value. PRCM module=20
register PRM_IO_PMCTRL[9]
WUCLK_STATUS logs the signal WUCLKOUT of the last pad of the I/O ring.=20
Once this status is set to 1,
the software may clear the PRM_IO_PMCTRL[8] WUCLK_CTRL bit to=20
effectively enable or disable the
wake-up feature within each pad."

The controls are exactly the same in case of OMAP3.
There is a global control at PRCM level (PRCM.PM_WKEN_WKUP[8] EN_IO)
and at pad level in SCM.

To assert the WUCLKIN, there is PRCM.PM_WKEN_WKUP[16] EN_IO_CHAIN
and to log the signal WUCLKOUT of the last pad there is
PRCM.PM_WKST_WKUP[16] ST_IO_CHAIN.

Its just that the registers in OMAP3 are named weirdly, the digram isn'=
t
any clear and the explanation in the TRM does not help much,
causing confusion.

This is mostly coming from pre 3430 es3 days when there was no
control for a WUCLKIN trigger in software. The hardware did this
based on per/core entering sleep states.

With 3430es3.1 and the subsequent 3630/4430/4460 silicons, the software
can decide when to enable/trigger iodaisy and it should ideally be done
before the powerdomain corresponding to the given module transitions to
RET or OFF. Until then the modules async wakeup is expected to generate
a wakeup.

IO daisy is actually designed so that it can be armed outside of idle,
by providing software control to generate the WUCLKIN pulse.

So as long as a module is clocked, it can generate interrupts, once
its clocks are cut, it can generate an async wakeup, and once the
powerdomain belonging to the module transitions to RET or OFF, it shoul=
d
be programmed to generate IO wakeup, independent of system idle state.
