Yes, I guess so.

I'm not quite sure I follow you here. Basically I think you want a 
generic "non-x86 PIO" framework that PCI just plugs into.

I don't think that necessarily means you want to statically allocate 
regions of that PIO space to separate (pseudo-)devices. Instead, 
everyone shares that space and should be able to fail gracefully if some 
space is already occupied.

Yes :).

I think only PPC, Microblaze and ARM are using this. Grep for 
PCI_IOBASE. It's not that many.

Well, getting our abstraction levels right to me sounds like it's worth 
the obstacles.

Yes. If you need to later on accelerate that bit, you can always do 
something like

   if (extio_entry->ops->pfin == pci_extio_in)
     return pci_extio_in(...);

which should get you all the prefetcher and branch prediction benefits 
that the current version gives you. But for starters I'd leave that out, 
since I doubt it'll have measurable performance impact to go via an 
indirect function call.

You can always replace the search with a tree. But to me that's an 
implementation detail that's easy enough to replace in a follow-up patch 
series.
