If you re-read the patch description that you quoted above, you'll see=20
that this behavior was clearly mentioned:

You should compare apples to apples.  The omap-serial.c without these two=
=20
patches is unusable as a console when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=3Dn; there are long=
=20
lags between transmit FIFO drains.  CONFIG_CPU_IDLE is the setting in the=
=20
standard omap2plus_defconfig.

I guess it was never tested with that standard config?  Or were the
v3.3 omap-serial patch series submitted with this bug known?

The only reason why the driver 'works' when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=3Dy is because=
=20
the omap-serial.c RX path wakeup latency constraint calculation is broken. =
=20
It adds a 1 microsecond latency constraint to the CPU, when it should be=20
adding a ~ 1100 microsecond latency constraint to the CPU.  (Well, ~ 5500=
=20
microsecond, but that's another issue.)

And this keeps the CPU from entering a low-power state not just during=20
transmits, but during the entire time the driver is active for the console=
=20
UART.

Yes, that's known behavior, as described in the quoted patch description. =
=20
It's not clear why the number of interrupts is ~5x the number of=20
transmitted bytes, rather than say 2x the number of transmitted bytes. =20
But the IRQ handler in omap-serial.c is also a mess, so that may have=20
something to do with it.

Do you have a better workaround for the CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=3Dn case that=20
is acceptable for the -rc series?  If so, perhaps you can post it?
