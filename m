Yes, I was thinking about turning the 'default' buffer allocation into
a library call which drivers would set, but I felt that's just asking
for a big patch and problems with new drivers appearing.

We could transition it by providing a default buffer allocation call,
converting all the drivers, and then making that call mandatory.  That
probably would then give us a better path to convert to kfifo.

The view that serial_core should be a library is one that Ted mentioned
when I created serial_core originally - I disagreed at the time, and
I still believe it would've ended up being much more complex - and
hairy - to go that route at that time.  Maybe as things have moved
forward in the tty layer that's changed, but I've been out of tty stuff
for too long to properly comment.
