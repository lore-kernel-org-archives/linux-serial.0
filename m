Looking at the facilities of the OMAP UART hardware and the behaviour o=
f
the DMA hardware, I don't think we have an option to manually insert an
x-char into the data stream.  We certainly can't pause TX DMA at the
DMA hardware without the DMA hardware aborting and flushing its FIFO,
and the UART has no way to temporarily suspend requesting DMA service.

So, I think we actually need a pair of new hooks from uart_throttle()
and uart_unthrottle() for these automatic flow control UARTs which
disable the RX FIFO being read (iow, disable RX interrupts if using PIO
or RX DMA if using DMA.)  The RX FIFO will then fill, and if the waterm=
arks
are set correctly along with hardware-assisted flow control, the UART
will send the XOFF or deassert RTS for us automatically.

At least with RX DMA (which is hardware source synchronised), the DMA
hardware will apparantly drain its FIFOs to memory when disabled, rathe=
r
than aborting and discarding its FIFO contents.

Well, it also depends on where I base my branches for development - and
if fixes go in after I've started then these things get missed until I
rebase those branches.

If it's already fixed, then great.

I've already cooked up a patch to handle this which adds new hooks from
serial_core into the low level driver for xmit buffer allocation/freein=
g.
