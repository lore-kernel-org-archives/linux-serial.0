Why do you think the order matters? My point was that we should
be able to register any region of logical port numbers for any
bus here.

Correct, but the DT knows nothing about logical port numbers in Linux.

To clarify: the special properties of having the first 0x1000 logical
port numbers go to a particular physical bus are very obscure. I think
it's more important to not change the behavior for existing systems
that might rely on it than for new systems that have no such legacy.

The ipmi and uart drivers in particular will get the port numbers filled
in their platform device from the DT bus scanning, so they don't care
at all about having the same numeric value for port numbers on the bus
and logical numbers, but other drivers might rely on particular ports
to be mapped on a specific PCI host, especially when those drivers
are  used only on systems that don't have more than one PCI domain.
