I've had no confirmation of that happening so far. I also don't know if I should expect one. Who'd take these patches? Tony?

Your questions got me thinking a bit more. I concluded that it's hard to define why this difference in performance is so big. I only got to it by just trying and seeing what would happen.

Ah yes. I'll see what I can do about it. It does make sense to get that data point somehow.
