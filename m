Reading the RX FIFO is something that goes back a long time in the 8250
driver, to the time when Ted Ts'o wrote the driver.

I would suggest that it remains there as the default (it was obviously
found to be necessary for x86 all those years ago when Linux was in
its infancy) and has survived for getting on 20 years without issue.
