Yes I understand, otherwise things certainly would not work :)

Right this is threaded-irq bottom half because the devices may
need to restore state and start regulators.

Hmm.. OK thanks this probably explains why pm_request_resume() did
not work.

For omaps, I could call this from the interconnect related code,
but then how dow we deal with the subsystems that don't call it?

Oh it naturally would not work in irq context, it's for the bottom
half again. But I'll take a look if we can just call
pm_request_resume() and disable_irq() on the wakeirq in without
waiting for the device driver runtime_suspend to disable the wakeirq.
That would minimize the interface to just dev_pm_request_wakeirq()
and dev_pm_free_wakeirq().
