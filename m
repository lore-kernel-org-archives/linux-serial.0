This series adds initial support for the Cortina Systems CS75xx
("Goldengate G2") network processors and the first board using one, the
Securifi Almond+ touchscreen Wi-Fi router (CS7542, 2x Cortex-A9 r2p1,
PL310 r3p1, 512 MiB DDR3, 512 MiB NAND).

There is no public documentation for the SoC. The register information
comes from the GPL vendor kernels (Linux 2.6.36 for the Almond+, Linux
4.9 for the Verizon FiOS G1100 which uses the same SoC) and from
disassembly of the stock U-Boot 2009.11. A full out-of-tree port
(clock, irqchip, GPIO, I2C, RTC, NAND, PCIe, MDIO and the packet engine)
runs on Linux 6.18 in OpenWrt; this series is the first, minimal step to
get the platform into mainline:

  - bindings: vendor prefix, SoC/board compatibles, an SMP enable method
    and the UART,
  - the platform Kconfig and SMP bring-up (the generic DT machine is
    used, there is no DT_MACHINE_START),
  - DEBUG_LL for UART0,
  - a UART driver with console and earlycon support,
  - SoC dtsi and board dts describing the CPUs, GIC, SCU, timers, L2,
    UARTs and memory,
  - multi_v7_defconfig and MAINTAINERS updates.

The serial binding and driver (patches 6-7) are meant to go through the
soc tree together with the rest of the series rather than through the
tty tree, with an Ack from the tty maintainers.

Testing: build tested with multi_v7_defconfig (GCC 14 and Clang 21,
W=1) and checked with dt_binding_check/dtbs_check. On a Securifi
Almond+ this series boots v7.4-rc1 to an initramfs shell with
both CPUs online ("smp: Brought up 1 node, 2 CPUs"; IPIs and the TWD
timer tick on both cores); the L2C-310, the global and TWD timers and
the UART driver (ttyCS0) come up. The kernel was started from a
running OpenWrt system with a small kexec-style loader rather than
from the stock U-Boot, because U-Boot enters the kernel with the MMU
on (see 2 below). The same patches on Linux 6.18 in OpenWrt, with the
head.S workaround from 2, also boot from NAND through the stock U-Boot;
that is how the secondary CPU wake-up fix in v4 was found.

Open questions:

1. The stock U-Boot arms the CPU0 private (TWD) watchdog before
   starting the kernel; without a driver the board resets after ~300
   seconds. The OpenWrt port disarms it in init_early, which I did not
   want to propose here. Instead, a driver for "arm,cortex-a9-twd-wdt"
   (the binding exists, but there is currently no driver for it) that
   takes over the running watchdog on all CPUs is written and tested
   on this board and posted on its own to the watchdog list, together
   with a restart handler (this series has no way to restart the SoC).
   Until it is merged, this series on its own boots but resets after
   ~5 minutes.
   Is a TWD watchdog driver the preferred way to deal with this?

2. The same U-Boot enters the kernel with the MMU and data cache
   enabled (identity map with XN set, dirty lines left in the D-cache),
   which breaks the decompressor. The OpenWrt port carries a small
   workaround at the start of arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S that
   cleans the cache and turns the MMU off. It is not part of this series.
   Replacing the bootloader is possible but risky for users of this
   (discontinued) device. Would a quirk of that kind be acceptable in
   head.S at all, or should this be solved outside the kernel (e.g. a
   chain-loaded bootloader)? For the tests below the kernel was started
   from a running Linux with the MMU off, so this was not an issue.

3. The APB clock is 100, 150 or 170 MHz depending on the boot strap pins.
   It is modelled as a fixed-clock with the rate set in the board dts.
   A clock driver for the global control block, which also contains the
   strap, pinmux and reset registers, will follow and replace it.

4. The Cortex-A9 r2p1 is also affected by errata 742230, 742231, 743622
   and 751472, whose workarounds are not available on multiplatform
   kernels because they are expected to be applied by the bootloader.
   The stock U-Boot does not apply them. Is there a preferred way to
   deal with this?

5. The UART ports are named ttyCS to avoid clashing with the 8250 driver
   in multi_v7_defconfig, and PORT_GENERIC is used instead of a new port
   type. The FIFO depth is not documented; the driver assumes 16.

6. The top 64 MiB of RAM are reserved: the vendor firmware gives them to
   the packet engine queue manager and the stock kernel is booted with
   mem=448M. The reservation will be referenced by the network driver
   later; I kept it now so that the memory is not handed out and later
   claimed.

Planned follow-ups, as separate series: the peripheral interrupt
controller, GPIO and I2C drivers (posted separately, one series per
subsystem, with their device tree nodes to follow once this series is
merged), the TWD watchdog (posted separately), then the global control
block/clock, RTC, NAND,
PCIe (DesignWare glue), MDIO, the Ethernet/packet engine and a fix for
the SX8650 touchscreen.

Changes in v7:
- rebase on v7.4-rc1
- cpus binding: the boot loader parks the secondary core in a WFI loop
  that polls the release register, not in a WFE loop
- goldengate: drop Linus' Reviewed-by, the patch changed in v4 and v5
  (wakeup IPI for the secondary core, PL310 erratum 769419); Linus,
  could you have another look?
- board dts: drop the ramoops region, it is only useful for development
- cover: the serial patches go with the rest of the series, not through
  the tty tree on their own (Krzysztof)
- move Signed-off-by after the other trailers
- collect Reviewed-by tags
- Link to v6: https://patch.msgid.link/20261013-b4-cs75xx-v6-0-37e8f3969b7c@gmail.com

Changes in v6:
- serial: also ignore overruns when CREAD is cleared, everything received
  is dropped then (sashiko-bot)
- Link to v5: https://patch.msgid.link/20261013-b4-cs75xx-v5-0-4e72aa383d39@gmail.com

Changes in v5:
- goldengate: select PL310_ERRATA_769419, the PL310 is r3p1-50rel0
  (CACHE_ID 0x410000c7), not r3p2 as v4 said; fix the revision in the
  commit message and here
- serial: scale the TX FIFO wait in putchar with the frame time, 10 ms is
  shorter than one character below 1200 baud (sashiko-bot)
- serial: no change for the other two sashiko-bot points on v4:
  uart_port_tx() checks tx_ready before it sends x_char, and SysRq is
  reachable through MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL_SEQUENCE; the UART has no break
  indication that the driver could use
- Link to v4: https://patch.msgid.link/20261012-b4-cs75xx-v4-0-df250d903682@gmail.com

Changes in v4:
- serial: use guard()/scoped_guard() for the port lock and the port
  table mutex (Jiri Slaby)
- serial: honour INPCK/IGNPAR: report parity and framing errors with
  TTY_PARITY/TTY_FRAME and insert the overrun marker after the characters
  still in the FIFO (sashiko-bot)
- goldengate: also send a wakeup IPI to the secondary core: the stock
  U-Boot parks it in WFI, SEV alone only worked when it was parked by
  another kernel (found booting from NAND instead of from RAM); the
  change is small, I kept Linus' Reviewed-by
- drop the RFC prefix
- Link to v3: https://patch.msgid.link/20261012-b4-cs75xx-v3-0-0e0d17a098cf@gmail.com

Changes in v3:
- serial: do not put the console setup callback in .init.text, it is
  called from a probe that may be deferred past boot (sashiko-bot)
- collect Reviewed-by tags
- Link to v2: https://patch.msgid.link/20261006-b4-cs75xx-v2-0-b7d6e1e24d44@gmail.com

Changes in v2:
- serial: drop the empty break_ctl, request_port and release_port
  callbacks, comment why set_mctrl stays, add a copyright line (Greg)
- serial: take the port lock around all IE accesses in startup, flush
  stale RX data on startup and disable the receiver on shutdown
- serial: bound the RX loop per interrupt, check RXDAT_VALID in
  poll_get_char, scale the console TX drain timeout with the frame time
- serial: serialise port index allocation, reject too low clock rates
- serial: name the driver after the vendor (cortina-uart.c,
  SERIAL_CORTINA), as the same block is used in the Cortina Access SoCs
  (Linus Walleij, Arnd Bergmann); the binding and the help text name
  the Cortina Systems CS75xx and Cortina Access parts (Jason Li)
- serial binding: describe the CS7542 only; other SoCs get their own
  compatible with "cortina,cs7542-uart" as fallback (Conor Dooley)
- debug: keep the character register intact on BE8 in senduart
- platform: move arch/arm/mach-cortina to arch/arm/mach-goldengate, as
  mach-gemini is a Cortina SoC too, and use one ARCH_CORTINA_ACCESS
  symbol for the whole family, as for the 64-bit Cortina Access parts,
  with the rationale in the commit message (Linus Walleij, Krzysztof
  Kozlowski, Arnd Bergmann); mach-goldengate vs. mach-cortina is still
  open, I am happy to rename the directory if mach-cortina is preferred
- collect Reviewed-by and Acked-by tags
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20260930-b4-cs75xx-v1-0-4617c4463529@gmail.com
