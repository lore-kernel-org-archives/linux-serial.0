I need this functionality for a real device having switchable
RS232/422/485 driver. So I need both RS232 signals, that are not all
possible to get via pinmux, and RS485 transmitter switching.

AFAIK RS485 feature is still not implemented in 8250. That's why I
would like this patch to be still included into omap_serial for now.
