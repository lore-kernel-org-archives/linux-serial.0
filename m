Hi,

I would like to mention another topic on supporting LPC, and this is 
regard to eSPI support.
eSPI is seen as the successor for LPC, and some BMCs already support it.

I had a chat with Arnd on this, and the idea to model LPC as a SPI bus 
adpater (and also eSPI).

However it seems to me that most platforms will/should support eSPI as a 
transparent bridge, same as LPC on x86. So I don't think that this is 
much point in modelling LPC/eSPI as a bus.

So we shall continue with indriect-IO support...

Thanks,
John
