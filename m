Hrm, yes. If we do not have prefetch and the destination is using FIFO =
- so
DMA pushes multiple elemets per DMA request this might be the case. But=
 I
think - nothing backs this up - if the transfer is element syncronized =
than we
would not loose data if the prefetch is not enabled. If we have prefetc=
h then
the DMA is prefetching data to it's FIFO and an abort will just send th=
e
content of the FIFO to /dev/null (or something).

Yes, the wording is not explicit and this is also my take on the issue =
- the
content of the FIFO is just dropped after it finished the ongoing eleme=
nt.

Yep. Let me try to get more information if I can.
