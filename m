From: "Govindraj.R" <govindraj.raja@ti.com>

Currently all low level uart driver register to serial_core layer
this core layer exposes various serial uart ops.

Currently the core layer provides startup and shutdown hooks
to low level driver, but in port suspend case the shutdown gets called
from uart_suspend_port this makes little difficult in low level driver
to any action specific to port closure.

For example if low level driver tries to disable uart platform
specific wakeups after port closure in low level driver it can be only done
in shutdown ops since this ops is called even in suspend case low level
driver needs some info whether the current shutdown ops is result of
port close or if its suspend ops.

To differentiate this expand the core layer uart_port info with closing flag
this flag is set to true during shutdown and set to false while port open.

Thus closing flag added with this patch can be used in low level driver to
identify the port close.
