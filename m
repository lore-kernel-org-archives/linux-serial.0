Yes.

OK, but please add comments to these functions about exactly why they
are needed.

Correct.

This isn't right either because devices that may not yet be initialized
(or loaded) may not have runtime PM enabled, so those devices may not
be properly idled.

We have an omap_device API to disable this feature at the PM domain lev=
el:
omap_device_disable_idle_on_suspend().  All you should have to do is to
use this API in the device init code on the console UART if
no_console_suspend has been enabled.
