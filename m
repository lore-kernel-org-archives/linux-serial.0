No, that is not an example of a protocol with a retry.  That is an example 
of a protocol that has no provision for reliable data delivery.  Sending a 
new data string one second later is not a retry.

In such situations, the system integrator would just use the UART in the 
default (lossless) mode.  And if they don't, they'll have to deal with the 
consequences that they chose.  Those of us who ship battery-powered Linux 
devices are indeed capable of making this choice.

One could argue that the PM runtime autosuspend timeout is not the 
appropriate place to change this setting, and that it should be somewhere 
else.  That's fine.  But that's a separate issue from removing the 
functionality completely.
