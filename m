Maybe. We might get away with returning zero bytes written in write().
But to me it seems better to stop things early when write is known
to not succeed.

I think we currently need to return zero bytes written from write()
when the serial port is not usable.

I don't think we can return a fake number of bytes written from write().

And even if we could return a fake number of bytes written, we could
run into issues doing the real write to the serial port.

Do you see issues with handling the errors in line disciplines?
