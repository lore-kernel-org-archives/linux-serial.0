Right.  We don't need the above patchwork patch if all UARTs are
initialized.

The other patch I was referring to was the one that added UART4 support
to omap_uart_idle_init() (added the wk_en, wk_st, padconf etc.)  I had =
a
pending request for you to drop the muxmode from that patch, but the
rest of it was still needed.

OK, be sure to test Zoom3, because my testing on Zoom3 led to a crash a=
s
soon as idle was enabled due to the missing init of all UARTs.

Thanks,
