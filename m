Yes fine, But there are scenarios even before first runtime_suspend hap=
pens,

ex: uart_port_configure -> get_sync -> pm_generic_runtime_resume
(omap_device_enable in this case) debug printk -> console_write -> get_=
sync.

there are numerous such scenarios where we end from runtime context
to runtime api context again, or jumping from one uart port operation
to uart print operation.

So either we should not have those prints from pm_generic layers or sup=
press
them(seems pretty much a problem for a clean design within the driver
using console_lock/unlock for every get_sync, and for
runtime_put we cannot suppress the prints as it gets scheduled later)

or if other folks who really need those prints form pm_generic* layers
to debug and analysis then we have no other choice rather control
the clk_enable/disable from outside driver code in idle path.

Govindraj.R

*pm_generic layers for omap, referring to omap_device/omap_hwmod layers
which does low level clock handling.
