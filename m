We'd like to use "timer" here because there are 2 different timer IPs
and we are sure that they won't be in the same SoC.
We think this implementation in VDSO should be platform independent to
get cycle-count register.
Our customer or other SoC provider who can use "timer" and define
cycle-count-offset or cycle-count-down then we can get the correct
cycle-count.

We sent atcpit100 patch last time along with our arch, however we'd
like to send it to its sub system this time and my colleague is still
working on it.
He may send the timer patch next week.

These properties are defined in dts which can provide the cycle count
register offset address of that timer, so that we can get cycle-count.

We only provide read permission to this page so hareware state won't
be chagned. It will trigger exception if we try to write.
We will check about the alignment/atomic issue of this region.

Thanks.
