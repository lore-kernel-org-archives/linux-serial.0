Hi,

I'm having trouble resuming from RAM suspend with the recent addition
of the new omap-serial driver. It appears to be in some sort of loop
in serial_omap_console_putchar() sometime after console_release_sem()
is called in the resume path. Has this driver been tested going into
and out of suspend?

Thanks,
