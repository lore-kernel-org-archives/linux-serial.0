Interesting idea. But I am very sceptical about it. I can't imagine
that anyone would like to configure 100k messages or so.

It is even worse than kernel configuration. And the trend is
to avoid config options where possible. It is because it is
almost impossible to understand all existing options and
make qualified decisions. And it is hard to expect that
users would be able to make a better decision than a developer
who implemented the code behind the option.

Our discussion is a nice example. Even we have troubles to
understand all consequences of different approaches. Even
if we reach a conclusion and document it. Then nobody
would want to read several pages long tutorial how to
configure printk ;-)
