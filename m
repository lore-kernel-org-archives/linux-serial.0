I too would prefer the bug to be fixed.

But calling it a regression is incorrect. There is no previous SHA in which this
problem didn't exist, except before either 8250_dma or 8250_omap was added.

>From the outset, both the 8250 dma code and the 8250_omap driver (mistakenly)
relied on dmaengine_pause.

A resource error is significantly different than ENOSYS or EINVAL.

That's your assertion; I've seen no documentation to back that up
(other than the de facto commit).

And quite frankly, that's absurd.

1. No other driver implements _only some_ use-cases of dmaengine_pause().
2. The number of users expecting dmaengine_pause to be implemented for
   non-cyclic dma transfers _dwarfs_ cyclic users.
3. There's a dedicated query interface, dma_get_slave_caps(), for which
   omap-dma returns /true/ -- not /maybe/ -- to indicate dmaengine_pause()
   is implemented.

As a consumer of the api, I'd much rather opt-out at device initialization
time knowing that a required feature is unimplemented, than discover it
at i/o time when it's too late.

An api which provides a means of determining if necessary functionality
is implemented _during setup_. That way the consumer of the api can
determine if the feature is supportable.

For example, dma_get_slave_caps() could differentiate
* pause for cyclic support
* pause for non-cyclic support
* pause and resume support
* pause and terminate support
....

Leaping to conclusions.

While Sebastian's initial patch is a good first-cut at addressing
8250_omap's use of omap-dma, none of the patches address the general
design problem I have outlined above; namely, that simply returning
an error at use time for an unimplemented slave transaction is
fundamentally flawed.
