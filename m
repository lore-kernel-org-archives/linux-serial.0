Hmm.  Let's say that the BT transceiver uses the fastest transmission rate=
=20
supported by the OMAP UARTs -- 3,686,400 bits per second, according to=20
Table 17-1 in the 34xx TRM vZR.  So the RX poll timer would go off about=20
~2.7 times per input character[1].  That seems like overkill...

For minimum receive latency, how about calling tty_insert_flip_string()=20
from the RX DMA callback, and using a smaller transfer count?  Or even=20
better, use PIO for the receive path and set the RX FIFO threshold to 1?

No poll timer should be needed in either case.

1. At 10 line bits per character (start + byte + stop), each character=20
should take about 2.7 microseconds to transfer (the reciprocal of (3 686=20
400 line bits per second / 10 line bits per character / 1 000 000=20
microseconds per second)).
