Having both makes sense. The reset driver probably doesn't care about 
differences between F4 and F7 (I know very little about F7 but I can't 
think of any obvious h/ware evolution that would confuse the current 
reset driver).

Thanks for the link. I had overlooked that (I only really started paying 
attention at v5; I should probably have looked further back before 
commenting).

However...

Arnd's concerns about mergability of headers can also be met by using 
h/ware values in the header file can't there. To be honest my comment 
was pretty heavily influenced after having read a recent patch from Rob 
Herring ( https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/1/14 ) which does exactly this.

The main reason I got interested in having a header is that the reset 
bits and the clock gate bits are encoded using the same bit patterns so 
I wondering it we could express that only once.

I guess it doesn't matter that much, especially given there is only one 
.dtsi file, and we can add a header later and remain binary compatible. 
However if the same number set does end up repeated in different .dtsi 
files I think that would motivate adding a header for F4 family.


Daniel.
