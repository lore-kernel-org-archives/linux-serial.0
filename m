Assuming the bad checksum messages are considered an emergency (for
example, at least loglevel KERN_WARN), then the new printk design would
print those messages synchronously to the slow serial line in the
context of the driver as the driver is producing them.

There wouldn't be a lock-up, but it would definitely slow down the
driver. The situation of "messages being produced faster than the kernel
can write them" would never exist because the printk() call will only
return after the writing is completed. I am curious if that would be
acceptable here?
