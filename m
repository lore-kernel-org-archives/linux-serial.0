OK, now, that makes sense :-)
We have hwmod in ENABLE state whereas the omap_device is still in IDLE 
or even DISABLE.

Fully agree, the fmwk should handle that.

That seems to be good. I'm just wondering if we need to introduce a new 
state for that or use a dedicated flag.
My concern is just that we will have two flavors of HWMOD_STATE_ENABLED 
that we will have to check in various places in the hwmod core code.

Maybe that's not such a big deal. Go ahead, and we will see how it looks 
like.

For the moment, it looks like only the serial is requiring such custom 
stuff, but anyway, we should have a mechanism to allow that...

Thanks,
