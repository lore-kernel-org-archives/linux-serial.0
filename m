Switching between dma transfers and pio should be easy to do, we're
already doing that in various omap drivers like mmc, musb/tusb
and onenand.

So I would recommend making that change, it is quite trivial
to do and will make the code much cleaner. And also gets rid
of the issue with Kconfig settings breaking booting for other
boards.

The bootargs should override what is passed from platform_data.
