No, I was thinking of HW sleepdeps.  However, I looked back at the
OMAP3430 TRM and see that MPU does not have a HW sleepdep on CORE like I
thought.

OK, that indeed makes sense.  Thanks for correcting me.

OK, good.

Yes, you're right.  The driver should not need to know which powerdomain
a given UART is in.  It's probably best (and most portable) to have UART
always express its requirements all the time.

Thanks for digging into this,
