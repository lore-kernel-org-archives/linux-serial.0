I think the rest of the timer registers should be fine to be read.
Anyway we will discuss about the security issue.

Based on our previous experiments.

Decrease 4,519,021 (47%)  cycle count for executing gettimeofday()
with: without vDSO(using syscall) =  5,091,342 : 9,610,363

The cycle count was get by CPU performance monitor.

Thanks.
