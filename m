Sorry forgot to mention why I think this can now be done in a
generic way, that's because we have now runtime PM in Linux.

OK yeah that would be a generic way to do it potentially ;)

Note that all the context_loss_cnt stuff in omap-serial.c can
then be ignored, that's still only needed for the omap3 legacy
mode booting case and won't be needed much longer.

OK great.

Yes that's the only safe approach so the serial port behaves in
the standard Linux way unless specifically requested by the
user.
