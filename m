No, "no translation" would be leaving out the ranges, we should
fix the code so it handles this case according to the specification
of the ISA DT binding, rather than adding an incorrect ranges
property to make it work with the incorrect Linux implementation.

of_translate_address() should fail here, and whichever code calls
it should try something else, possibly something we have to
implement that can return the correct IORESOURCE_* type.

The only thing it can realistically conflict with would be another
LPC bus behind on a PCI host bridge. On ARM64, all regular PCI
devices that have IORESOURCE_IO ports are intentionally moved
to (bus) port numbers above 0x1000.

You should not do that in the serial driver, please just use the
normal 8250 driver that works fine once you handle the entire
port range.
