Yes, I missed that the api included a return code which the 8250 dma
code should be checking.

You'd be reading a lot into my statement.

Done.

This is simply a bug that flew under the radar, much like every other
bug that gets fixed daily in mainline.

The omap-serial driver which doesn't use dma is still the preferred
stable driver for omap, for the moment.

One of the main features of the 8250_omap integration was the addition
of dma support. Without it, 8250_omap is ttyO in ttyS clothing.
