My point is that hacks/workaround for DEBUG_LL + earlyprintk don't
belong in this driver, since this driver is not involved.

OK, let me try this a slightly different way.  Here's what you did:

- remove some code in patch 4
- add it back in patch 7, but in different form (with no description of=
 diffs)
- the missing parts of original code are not documented
- moved code has some new (but undocumented) features (module-level wak=
eup)
- turns out the missing parts (IO pad wakeups) are done using a
  different framework in yet another patch (which would be fine, if it
  the reviewers were given a hint.)

I hope this is enough to demonstrate that trying to decipher what what
you meant to do, what you did, and what you didn't do is extremely
time consuming for a reviewer.

Well-constructed patches, broken up into *logical* chunks with
descriptive changelogs are invaluable to an efficient review process.

These are the kinds of things that belong in a descriptive changelog.
