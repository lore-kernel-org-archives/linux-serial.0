Ok. I'm going to attack them and make a report.

We have pl080 under PCI, so we have patches in the queue to fix this
header problem.  I just didn't submit them yet, but now they are part
of this fixup effort and I'll check them over.

Yes. I'm going to make a status report soon, counting and classifying
all errors I encounter when enabling all amba drivers under x86.
