This is was Uwe Kleine-K=C3=B6nig suggested off-list:

|Currently there are two drivers for the serial device. Until the new o=
ne
|matured enough to drop the old one, let them conflict each other. They
|both handle the same devices, but only one can be responsible for a
|single device. There is no technical need, but having two drivers in t=
he
|same kernel might result in surprises.

I personally don't mind having two drivers enabled since the makefile
order is always the same. My main concern is the ttyOx -> ttySx switch
after the newer driver is enabled by default via defconfig (and the use=
r
does not know it). "make oldconfig" is covered by "default n".
Uwe's has a point about "matured enough to drop the old one". It isn't
mentioned anywhere that the newer driver supports also DMA. Is this
something we want to add to the help text?
Could someone that will probably be dealling with possible fallout comm=
ent
on this? This patch shouldn't go in without an ACK.
