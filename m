There is only Ethernet connected to this bus (apart from PSRAM), so it
might be wider, but there is no indication of this in documentation.

I just keep things simple ;)

Indeed, block diagram indicates all them as a "FPGA APB subsystem" and
clearly draws a line indicating a bus those devices are connected to.
After your point about lan9220, it looks clearer to me to express that
subsystem outside of soc/ node indicating bus interface, so it would
match to those drawings closely.
