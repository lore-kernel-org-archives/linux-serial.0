I quote:

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I say again: I was _only_ suggesting further investigation, yet you
were mouthing off about causing a regression to beagleboard "because
of that", effectively saying that no, we should not do any further
investigation and this is the only fix.

Well, I've just spent five minutes analysing the code paths - which I
hadn't looked at before - and I've pointed out what's probably causing
the problem for Beagle.  I think you owe me an appology over your
aggressive attitude towards my suggestions that there needed to be
some further investigation.
