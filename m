Yes, it is a known issue and the fix was unfortunately was not merged 
during -rc phases but is fixed in 3.4 and should be fixed in 3.3 stable 
branch as well. I received the notification from Greg KH 2 weeks ago 
about the stable: Patch "tty: serial: OMAP: Fix oops due to NULL pdata 
in DT boot" has been added to the 3.3-stable tree

You should just switch to 3.4-rc2 or get the patch if you are stuck to 3.3.

Benoit
