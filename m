Dear Linux kernel code maintainer,

on rechecking the current stable kernel code, I found some places where jiffies
were compared in a way that seems to break when they wrap. For these,
I made up patches to use the macros "time_before()" or "time_after()"
that are supposed to handle wraparound correctly.

For a small part of the patches, I believe you to be the relevant kernel code
maintainer. Appended to this email you will find some lines explaining
why I decided to mail or cc: you on this (an extract of the copyright notice
or the MAINTAINERS file), followed by the patch itself. If I mailed you
in error, please drop me a short note.

I kindly ask you to approve the correctness of the patch, and pass it on to
the relevant people for inclusion into the mainline kernel.

Thanks,
Tim Schmielau (tim@physik3.uni-rostock.de)
