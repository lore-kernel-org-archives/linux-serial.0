I am not so sure what is your ideas on this. Do you mean the snippet like these:

#define BUILD_IO(bw, type)					\
type extio_in##bw(unsigned long addr) 				\
{ 								\
	struct io_range *entry = find_io_range(addr); 		\
								\
	if (entry) 						\
		return entry->ops->pfin(entry->devpara, 	\
			addr, sizeof(type)); 			\
	return read##bw(PCI_IOBASE + addr);			\
}

we add the last 'return read##bw(PCI_IOBASE + addr);' to keep the original logic of inX() in asm-generic/io.h;
In above snippet, all the hosts applied extio should register their own ops->pfin().
