fixed.

I don't know of any. (except someting changes things like regshift after
the initialization phase ... :o)

Actually, I don't see anything talking to the hardware at all here.
It's all derived from values that are set up before
serial8250_register_8250_port() is called.

I don't really understand :(
Do you mean the splitting off the retval part from the rest ?

Is that really necessary ? Maybe it's just my personal taste, but I
don't feel the more more verbose one is really easier to read.
