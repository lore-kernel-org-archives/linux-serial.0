I am going to summarize my understanding here below:

It seems to me that what is linearized is the virtual address
space associated to the IO address space. This address space
goes from PCI_IOBASE to (PCI_IOBASE + IO_SPACE_LIMIT).

The I/O accessors perform rd/wr operation on this address
space using a port IO token.

Each token map into a cpu physical address range
Each cpu physical address range maps to a bus address range
if the bus controller specifies a range property.

Devices under a bus controller specify the bus addresses that
they operate on in their reg property.

So each device can use the same bus addresses under two
separate bus controllers as long as the bus controller
use the range properties to map the same bus range to different
cpu address range.

Are you saying that our LPC controller should specify a
range property to map bus addresses into a cpu address range?

I have to look better into this...can you provide me a reference
to the Bjorn argument in favor of this approach?

I don't get this much...I/O tokens that are passed to the I/O
accessors are not fixed anyway and they vary depending on the order
of adding ranges to io_range_list...so I don't see a big issue
with this...

Correct and ideally if the INDIRECT_MAX_IO approach was taken then we
should define INDIRECT_MAX_IO for any architecture that can support the
special LPC devices. We would define it for ARM64 just because LPC
is used in our case under ARM64; the idea was to leave other architecture
to define their own ones as needed...but probably this is wrong and
we should have defined this for all the architectures.
