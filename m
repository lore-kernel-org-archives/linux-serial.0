No. Can't you add in arch/ndis32/Kconfig ?

+select TIMER_ATCPIT100

Like:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm64/Kconfig#n50

I received a [Vx y/3] series and I received a [Vx y/39].

The former from Rick Chen means to me "please pick them through your tree".

The latter from you means to me "can you ack the patches so I can merge
them through my tree". Note you will have to resend the entire arch
series for every single review/comment (that could end up upset the
Cc'ed people).

Which one should I review ? I can not track different patchset
implementing the same thing. Which one should I comment, review ? Are
the comments I did on [Vx y/3] taken into account in the arch series ?
etc ...

Please clarify, it is confusing and impossible to review in this situation.

I suggest we stick to the x/3 series, so I can comment it and you can
resend a new version without resending the entire arch series. So I can
merge it through my tree, and you get it via eg. a shared immutable
branch. The arch series will be reduced by 3 patches.
