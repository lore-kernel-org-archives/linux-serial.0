Paul,

Please, correct me if I'm wrong, you're experiencing issues on Tx, or
Rx direction? You've said that characters are echoed incorrectly, but
haven't mentioned in what direction issue appears?
For reference, I'll quote TI DM3730 Rev.R TRM:
TRM page 2953, LSR_REG
Bit #5: TX_FIFO_E
 0x0 Transmit hold register (TX FIFO) is not empty.
 0x1 Transmit hold register (TX FIFO) is empty. The transmission is
not necessarily complete.

Before my patch: there was a check for TX_FIFO_E to be 0x1 before
filling Tx FIFO
After: If THR interrupt is raised, then there is a space in FIFO and
threshold has reached it's level, no extra check is required

TRM page 2972, SCR_REG
Bit #4: TX_EMPTY_CTL_IT
 0x1 The THR interrupt is generated when TX FIFO and TX shift register
are empty.
 0x0 Normal mode for THR interrupt (see Table 19-33 for details about
UART mode interrupts)

Before: THR interrput is raised only when TX FIFO and TX shift
register are empty, for shortcut "all Tx lane empty"
After: THR interrupt is raised both when Tx lane is empty, or when
size of data in Tx lane falls below Tx threshold level

Bit #7: RX_TRIG_GRANU1
 0x0 Disables the granularity of 1 for TRIGGER RX level
 0x1 Enables the granularity of 1 for TRIGGER RX level

Before: RX FIFO Trigger Level "Defined by the concatenated value of
RX_FIFO_TRIG_DMA and
RX_FIFO_TRIG (from 1 to 63 characters with a granularity of 1 character).
Note: The combination of RX_FIFO_TRIG_DMA = 0x0 and RX_FIFO_TRIG =
0x0 (all zeros) is not supported (minimum 1 character required). All
zeros result
in unpredictable behavior."

After: RX FIFO Trigger Level "Defined by the UARTi.FCR_REG[7:6]
RX_FIFO_TRIG field (8,16, 56, or 60
characters)" (as it should be according to comments in source code)
