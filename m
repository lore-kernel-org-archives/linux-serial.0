The warning can wait.

But the regression needs fixing.

It _is_ in the right place.  dmaengine_pause() always has been permitted
to fail.  It's the responsibility of the user of this API to _check_ the
return code to find out whether it had the desired effect.  Not checking
the return code is a bug in the caller's code.

If that wasn't the case, dmaengine_pause() would have a void return type.
It doesn't.  It has an 'int' to allow failure, or to allow non-
implementation for cases where the underlying hardware can't pause the
channel without causing data loss.

What would you think is better: an API which silently loses data, or
one which refuses to stop the transfer and reports an error code back
to the caller.

You seem to be arguing for the former, and as such, there's no way I
can take you seriously.

In any case, Greg has now commented on the patch adding the feature,
basically refusing it for stable tree inclusion.  So the matter is
settled: omap-dma isn't going to get the pause feature added in stable
trees any time soon.  So a different solution now needs to be found,
which is what I've been saying all along...
