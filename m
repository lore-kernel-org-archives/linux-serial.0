But this is part of a bigger picture.  Namely, if a separete wakeup interrupt
is required for a device, the device's power.can_wakeup flag cannot be set
until that interrupt has been successfully requested.  Also for devices that
can signal wakeup via their own IO interrupts, it would make sense to allow
those interrupts to be registered somehow as "wakeup interrupts".

So I wonder if we can define a new struct along the lines of your
struct wakeirq_source, but call it struct wake_irq and make it look
something like this:

struct wake_irq {
       struct device *dev;
       int irq;
       irq_handler_t handler;
};

Then, add a struct wake_irq pointer to struct dev_pm_info *and* to
struct wakeup_source.  Next, make dev_pm_request_wake_irq() allocate the
structure and request the interrupt and only set the pointer to it from
struct dev_pm_info *along* *with* power.can_wakeup if all that was
successful.

For devices that use their own IO IRQ for wakeup, we can add something
like dev_pm_set_wake_irq() that will work analogously, but without requesting
the interrupt.  It will just set the dev and irq members of struct wake_irq
and point struct dev_pm_info to it and set its power.can_wakeup flag.

Then, device_wakeup_enable() will be able to see that the device has a
wakeup IRQ and it may then point its own struct wake_irq pointer to that.
The core may then use that pointer to trigger enable_irq_wake() for the
IRQ in question and it will cover the devices that don't need separate
wakeup interrupts too.

Does that make sense to you?
