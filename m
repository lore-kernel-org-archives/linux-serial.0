Incorrect.

static int omap_dma_pause(struct dma_chan *chan)
{
        struct omap_chan *c = to_omap_dma_chan(chan);

        /* Pause/Resume only allowed with cyclic mode */
        if (!c->cyclic)
                return -EINVAL;

Asking for the channel to be paused will return an error code indicating
that the request failed.  That will be propagated back through to the
return code of dmaengine_pause().

If we look at what 8250-dma.c is doing:

                if (dma->rx_running) {
                        dmaengine_pause(dma->rxchan);

It's 8250-dma.c which is silently _ignoring_ the return code, failing
to check that the operation it requested worked.  Maybe this should be
WARN_ON(dmaengine_pause(dma->rxchan)) or at least it should print a
message?

Well, that's where the bug lies, and I don't agree with your assessment
that it would mean reverting the whole thing.

The binding between the two drivers is controlled via DT.  DT tells it
which DMA controller and which DMA input to use.  So, as DMA is currently
broken on this, the solution is to break that link so that 8250-omap goes
back to using PIO only.

Well, we have reached an impass then.

I'm not going to accept a feature addition to a driver as a stable patch
without it being adequately tested over _several_ kernel revisions to
ensure that we don't end up cocking up some driver which uses the DMA
interfaces correctly.  It's too big a risk.

So, I guess that means that older kernels will just have to remain broken -
all because the basic testing of the original code was never undertaken
to ensure that basic stuff like reception of characters worked properly.

Sorry, I have little sympathy here.
