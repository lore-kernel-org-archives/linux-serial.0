s/direclty/directly/

My understanding of ISA (which may be flawed) is that it's not part of
the PCI host bridge, but rather on x86 it happens to share the IO space
with PCI.

So, how about this becomes:

  Hisilicon Hip06 SoCs implement a Low Pin Count (LPC) controller, which
  provides access to some legacy ISA devices.

I believe that we could theoretically have multiple independent LPC/ISA
busses, as is possible with PCI on !x86 systems. If the current ISA code
assumes a singleton bus, I think that's something that needs to be fixed
up more generically.

I don't see why we should need any architecture-specific code here. Why
can we not fix up the ISA bus code in drivers/of/address.c such that it
handles multiple ISA bus instances, and translates all sub-device
addresses relative to the specific bus instance?

This would be better as something like:

	"hisilicon,hip06-lpc-controller"

If it's reused in other SoCs, we can add more strings as we usually do.

My comment above on the compatible string also applies.

Please remove the status property; it's irrelevant to the example.

Why not bool?

I don't think this is the right thing to do, regardless.

I don't believe this is the right place for this to live. This should
live in the isa of_bus, matched in the usual way with of_match_bus(),
and used in pbus->translate() in of_translate_one().

If we need to extend the prototypes of those functions, we should do so.

If we need to be able to register instance-specific translations or
indirection, we should build the infrastructure for that rather than
forcing a singleton translation in here.

Thanks,
Mark.
