Link:

Branch:
pm-wip/uart

If you are trying to use with any client device connected to uart
then we need to ensure the client driver speaks to omap-serial
dev entries.

The client device application may be designed to speak to
8250 entries probably you may need to check.

In that case you need to change device name to that of 8250
so that no change is needed in application though and in that way
we make it to speak with omap-serial.
