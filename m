... and so you introduce a silent data loss bug into the driver.  That's
not very clever.

That may be how 8250 works, but 8250 is not everything.  You can't ignore
this problem.  You have to deal with it - either by not allowing a channel
that would loose data to be paused, or by recovering from that condition.
You're not doing either in your patch.

Therefore, I have no other option but to NAK your change.  Sorry.

Please fix this.
