A 32KiHz cycles every 30mSec.
At 115200 bps, there is one bit every 8.7 microseconds.

When I type "return" - which looks like 0101100001111... on the wire,
I see '0xC3' which looks like 011000011111... on the wire.
So we lost exactly 2 bits, or a delay around 17 microseconds.

I find it hard to reconcile that delay with the cause being a 32KiHZ clock.

If the first char I type is a space (0x20 or 0000001001111111) then
the character received is 0x90 (0000010011111) which is exactly 1 bit missi=
ng,
so an 8 or 9 usec delay.
If the first char I type is 'o' (0x6f, or 0111101101111111) then the charac=
ter
received is 0xfb (01101111111111) which misses 5 bits.
I think it misses the first bit, then waits for a start bit (0), then takes
the next 8 bits.

At 230400 bps, I always lose at least 2 bits.
At 460800 bps, I seem lose at least 3 bits.
(above there, nothing works at all ... could be my USB/serial cable at faul=
t).

So it looks a lot like a delay which is a small number of microseconds.
Could be the wake-up latency in the I/O ring/chain, but doesn't look like t=
he
32 KiHz clock :-)

Correct.
