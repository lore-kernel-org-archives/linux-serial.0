You normally shouldn't need CONFIG_EXPERT in a defconfig file, by definition
this is needed for unusual configurations only.

Having a built-in DTB also makes no sense for a defconfig, when the idea is that
it can run on as many machines as possible.

Having ramdisk built-in is rather unusual, most users don't use ramdisks
any more since we don't need it for booting with the initramfs.

These also look unusual. Would it make sense to have these as loadable
modules, or do you require having everything built-in for your workflow?

It seems the sound subsystem is enabled, but no drivers are selected,
so it won't actually do anything.

Same for MMC. If you are still trying to get the respective device drivers
merged, that doesn't need to stop you from enabling the configurations
here.
