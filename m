So should it be done just here or also in the idle path?  In general,
I'm certainly for moving things out of the idle path into the places
where they belong.

However, I don't get from the TRM description below that it should be
done every time a pad-level wake is enabled or disabled.  Can you
clarify what part of the TRM description you mean?

All I understand is that it has to be done before PER domain
transisions.

Also, if this were to happen, are there side-effects of having the IO
daisy chain armed outside the idle path?
