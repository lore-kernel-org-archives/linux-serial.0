I think what people need to learn is that an API in the kernel which
returns an int _can_ fail - it returns an int so it _can_ return an
error code.  If it _can_ return an error code, there _will_ be
implementations which _do_.

If you don't check the return code, either your code doesn't care whether
the function was successful or not, or you're playing with fire.  This is
a prime example of playing with fire.

Let's leave the crappy userspace laziness with regard to error checking
to userspace, and keep it out of the kernel.

Yes, the DMA engine capabilities may not be sufficient to describe every
detail of DMA engines, but that's absolutely no reason to skimp on error
checking.  Had there been some kind of error checking at the site, this
problem would have been spotted before the 8250-omap driver was merged.
