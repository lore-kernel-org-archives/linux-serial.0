It's true, mainline kernel won't run on that board out of the box, but
patches to
support it go only in mach-types.h and board-omap3logic.c

Yes, it's serial console port on UART0 (console=ttyO0,115200n8)

Corruption is on Tx path. Without my patch (but with patch to allow 1Mbaud):
Interrupt to refill Tx FIFO is raised only after entire FIFO is
transmitted (that is, no data left in FIFO to be sent),
and it takes kernel 25us to handle interrupt and refill FIFO. Issue is
in condition when UART triggers interrupt.
According to original sources, this interrupt is configured to be
raised only when TX FIFO is (fully) empty, while
ignoring Tx FIFO threshold level completely, although it's being
(almost) properly configured and enabled.
So, what my patch changes is basically when interrupt to refill Tx
FIFO is raised:
 - from "when empty" to "when threshold is reached", refs:
OMAP_UART_SCR_TX_EMPTY flag
   should not be set, and UART_LSR_THRE check is also invalid, since
blocks threshold level situation.
 - setting OMAP_UART_SCR_RX_TRIG_GRANU1_MASK will lead to incorrect
interpretation
   of threshold level settings (inconsistent with comments in driver
sources itself).

I mean that I've seen gap issues both with CONFIG_PM=y and CONFIG_PM=n
After my patch I saw gap issues only several times, and _probably_
that is due to CONFIG_PM=y,
since I've never seen them after that with CONFIG_PM=n

I should point that tests I run are completely user-space, so I've
never tested UARTs
using oscilloscope during kernel boot. But, no issues in serial
console seen, as I've
already pointed out.
