Hi Greg,

These patches have a dependency on the omap-serial runtime series.
So once that makes it in, through the serial driver tree, and once we
have the necessary Acks from the Device Tree maintainers on the relevant
patches from this series, these could go through the serial driver tree
as well.

thanks,
Rajendra
