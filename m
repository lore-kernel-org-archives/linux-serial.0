Yes these are required, because early printk relies on clocks from bootload=
er
and if clocks are gated even before console_driver is available it can
lead to boot failures.

I can keep that part as a separate patch.

If are referring to uart rx pad wakeup its still retained but done
using mux framework.

Prior to this we used io-pad offsets address and modified to enable wakeup
mechanism, But since we received some comments from Tony to use mux framewo=
rk
for any mux changes, I removed using mux address and use mux framework from
hwmod, I have not removed rx-pad wakeup still enable io-pad wakeup.
otherwise wakeup from off-mode will fail on 3430SDP.

OMAP2+: hwmod: Add API to enable IO ring wakeup.]

boot-loaders doesn't enable io pad wakeup for uart.

will add as separate patch.

Yes correct, But pwr domain callback will now cut all enabled clocks
now, so only available method was to use console_lock and print later.

pwr_domain callback done in omap-device.c
will force to low powers state by gating all clocks that where left
enabled by driver.
