Both 1 and 2 are needed.

The current way that errata are handled in arch/arm/mach-omap2/serial.c 
needs to be changed.  Those should be flags that are passed from hwmod 
dev_attr data.  The presence of the TX wakeup bit should simply be another 
dev_attr flag.  These flags should be passed to the driver via the 
omap_up.errata field for the time being.

The exception to this is if the IP block's revision register was changed 
when TX wakeups became possible.  If that's the case, then that mechanism 
can be used in lieu of dev_attr and platform_data in this situation.
