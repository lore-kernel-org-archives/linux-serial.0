No, the whole point of this mess is that omap-dma does not provide pause/resume
support (without data loss). omap-dma will only be suitable for pause/terminate dma.

And adding pause support doesn't address the underlying problem that dmaengine
is not providing a means of determining if suitable support is available for
use by serial drivers, so this same problem is just waiting to happen again.

I think the way forward is,

For -stable, disable dma in the 8250_omap driver.
Then for mainline,
* extend the dma_get_slave_caps() api to differentiate the types of pause support
* query dma_get_slave_caps() when setting up the slave channel in 8250_dma & 8250_omap
  and only enable dma if suitable pause support is available
* add required dmaengine error checking in 8250_dma & 8250_omap _for unexpected errors_
  (so _not_ WARNs)
* do whatever with omap-dma. Not even sure it's worth trying to support dma with that;
  it still won't fully support tx dma which is forcing all kinds of goofy workarounds


Russell seemed to think that the current dma operation was necessary information to
differentiate types of pause support, but I don't think that's required.
As Sebastian's omap-dma driver patch shows, partial pause support has more
to do with how it's being used.
