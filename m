Hi Kevin,

Thanks for the review.

Yes I have to remove that line.

errata 2.15, yes correct force idle mode if in dma mode
need to incorporated into runtime suspend call back.

the things I moved from here to driver :

1.) prepare and resume calls, Yes I can incorporate 9/11 into this patc=
h.

2.) mdr errata movement - yes can be part of this change.

3.) context restore is part of runtime resume call back so I think
that should be part of runtime patches itself. Also force idle mode err=
ata 2.15
missed out also should be part of runtime suspend hook.
so cant be part of this change here.

Ok.

Actually when we use early_printk option from CONFIG_DEBUG_LL
we use the debug-macro.s file to do put-char of early kernel prints unt=
il
a console driver is available, So while debug-macros does putchar from =
uart
if we try to reset console uart during hwmod_init this will cause uart
to go to bad state
and still no console driver available and can halt uart during bootup.

reset from hwmod -> putchar from earlyprintk driver doing tx on uart ??

Since softreset from hwmod can loose uart configuration from bootloader
and earlyprintk driver is unaware of this and does tx on uart.

Hence we still need this code to avoid uart reset & idle during bootup.

yes, will check that option.
