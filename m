okay, the right place would be serial_omap_pm
to do add runtime forbid.

whenever the uart port is used it will call serial_omap_pm
with state param assigned value zero from serial_core layer
for open system call from user space.

Also when uart port is closed it will shutdown where we can add runtime=
_allow.
So for uart ports not wakeup capable keep uart clocks on until
used and once port is shutdown cut uart clocks.
