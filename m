If it used to work and it doesn't now it's a regression. It's also a
nasty one if you've removed the facility for it.

Yep

That was basically insoluble when the lock first went in. We tried with a
spinlock but a lot of USB widgets need to go and chatter with the device
when you do flow control. Flow control is fundamentally ordered but
asynchronous however so if the right fix was to make the USB dongles
queue the work then no harm is done (and the queued flow control
assertion would worst case be no different to a non queued one from a
queued flush_to_ldisc)

If you pass a snapshot of the termios state down then I think it does,
but it's still not remotely trivial.

First question though comes before all of this - and that is do we need
low_latency at all any more or is the current scheduling logic now good
enough to do the job anyway.
