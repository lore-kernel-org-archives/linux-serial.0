I see that too - I'm glad someone else does :-)

If I look at the corruption as compared to the expected character, it is
always the case some it has been shifted down a few bits, with '1's shifted
in the top.
As bytes are sent lsb first followed by stop bits which are '1', this is
completely consistent with clocking the bits in a little bit late.

I see this with baud rates of 115200 and higher, but never with lower.

My theory is that there is a delay between the falling RX line waking the
system up, and the CPU enabling the UART - whether enabling the clocks or
doing a full config, I am not sure - though I think the former.

Maybe if we could enable the UART clocks immediately after returning from t=
he
WFI instruction we could avoid the corruption....
