If you have the tty in raw mode then that is basically what the ldisc
code does (plus any flow control you may have selected).

Ditto in raw mode, and you can use O_NDELAY or the VMIN/VTIME fields to
optimise block transfer behaviour. We do actually do an additional
memcpy but memory copies of cached memory are so cheap it should be
irrelevant unless trying to do megabit speeds on low end embedded
processors.

Based upon what analysis ?

Are you using USB ports ?
