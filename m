No. start_tx() will be called multiple times but only the first
invocation invoke pm_runtime_get(). Now I noticed that I forgot to
remove pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() at the bottom of it. But you get
the idea right?
pm_get() on the while the UART_IER_THRI is not yet set. pm_put() once
the fifo is completely empty.

No, it didn't.

omap-serial and the 8250 do the following on tx path:
- start_tx()
  -> sets UART_IER_THRI. This will generate an interrupt once the FIFO
     is empty.
- interrupt, notices the empty fifo, invokes serial8250_start_tx()/
  transmit_chars().
  Both have a while loop that fills the FIFO. This loop is left once
  the tty-buffer is empty (uart_circ_empty() is true) or the FIFO full.

Lets say you filled 64 bytes into the FIFO and then left because your
=46IFO is full and tty-buffer is empty. That means you will invoke
serial_omap_stop_tx() and remove UART_IER_THRI bit.
This is okay because you are not interested in further FIFO empty
interrupts because you don't have any TX-bytes to be sent. However,
once you leave the transmit_chars() you leave serial_omap_irq() which
does the last pm_put(). That means you have data in the TX FIFO that is
about to be sent and the device is in auto-suspend.
This is "fine" as long as the timeout is greater then the time required
for the data be sent (plus assuming HW-float control does not stall it
for too long) so nobody notices a thing.

=46or that reason I added the hack / #if0 block in the 8250 driver. To
ensure we do not disable the TX-FIFO-empty interrupt even if there is
nothing to send. Instead we enter serial8250_tx_chars() once again with
empty FIFO and empty tty-buffer and will invoke _stop_tx() which also
finally does the pm_put().
That is the plan. The problem I have is how to figure out that the
device is using auto-suspend. If I don't then I would have to remove
the #if0 block and that would mean for everybody an extra interrupt
(which I wanted to avoid).

Yes, probably. That means one get at dma start, one put at dma complete
callback. And I assume we get that callbacks once the DMA transfer is
complete, not when the FIFO is empty :) So lets leave it to the future
for now=85
