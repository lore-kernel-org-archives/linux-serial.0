Can you give me an idea of your device's average and minimum required
latency (please be specific)?  Is your target arch x86 [so I can evaluate the
the impact of bus-locked instructions relative to your expected]?

Also, how painful would it be if unsupported termios changes were rejected
if the port was in low_latency mode and/or if low_latency setting was
disallowed because of termios state?

It would be pointless to throttle low_latency, yes?

What would be an acceptable outcome of being unable to accept input?
Corrupted overrun? Dropped i/o? Queued for later? Please explain with
comparison to the outcome of missed minimum latency.

Regards,
Peter Hurley
