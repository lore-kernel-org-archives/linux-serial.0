currently using the HCI line discipline is the only way to attach a Bluetooth device to a serial line / UART.

However I have been advocating for a serial bus or UART bus for a long time now. It is needed especially for Bluetooth devices which have no business in being exposed as TTYs in the first place.

This is true for the ACPI and DT world actually. Some UARTs should not be exposed as TTY and just be stuck on a bus that can be enumerated and matched by a driver that knows how to handle it.

This goes along with the weird fetish to expose certain Bluetooth GPIOs as RFKILL switches. They are not that either since they just power the UART. They have nothing to do with a radio RFKILL switch. We fixed the Intel and Broadcom ones to be mapped into the driver. Having a proper bus would make this one also a lot easier.

Regards

Marcel
