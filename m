Actually this patch is related to my previous patch "tty: cleanup
duplicate functions in tty_buffer". Some drivers call the
tty_schedule_flip() function instead of tty_flip_buffer_push(). In
that case the work queue is always used, regardless the
tty->low_latency flag. That's why tried to get rid of the
tty_schedule_flip() function.

But from the first review remarks on the "tty: cleanup duplicate
functions in tty_buffer" patch, that patch seems to be invalid. So in
that case this patch is invalid also.

Regards,
Ivo Sieben
