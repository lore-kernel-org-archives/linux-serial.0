Mark,
I think I can't tell anything more before I try to implement it in a way you 
suggest, so I will.

What I would like to retain from the current codec driver are those two modes 
of operation: without and with the line discipline activated. Initially, the 
codec would be registered as a platform device, as it is now. Activation of 
the line discipline would deregister the codec device from the platform bus 
and reregister it again, now as the line discipline provided device. Is this 
possible with current ASoC framework?

Thanks,
Janusz
