To avoid confusion, can you please add this to the description:

Note that the UART wakeup events configured in the 8250 hardware only
work for idle modes that do not cut off power for the UART. For deeper
idle states, dedicated padconf wakeirqs must be used. Or in some cases
the UART RX pin can be remuxed to GPIO input if the GPIO block stays
powered.

I tested this briefly and the dedicated wakeirqs still work for me,
so from that point of view:
