No, or if the omap_l3_smx.c can show the address it's not implemented.

The udev solution will not help with all the existing cases of
console=3DttyO2,115200. But maybe we just need to translate the
cmdline to ttS2 in those cases?

Then the udev rules could fix up most of the distro issues, but
not all of them. And still requires the userspace to be updated.

Yeah the symlinks won't work, think read-only rootfs for example :)

Yeah me too.
