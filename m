I'm not totally convinced of that.

Does a RX timeout ensure that sdma won't try to complete the transaction
if more rx data arrives between the raising of the rx timeout interrupt
and the pausing of rx transaction?

My guess is not, which will result in lost data in normal operation.

Also, this error is reported during normal operation, which is bogus.
The h/w descriptor has completed but the completion handler has not yet been
called, so the "error" is expected.

Which, laughably, is the same error code (-EINVAL) omap-dma uses to "creatively"
report it doesn't actually support pause/resume, despite what dma_get_slave_caps()
reports.

Totally agree. But at some point, working around h/w becomes prohibitive;
maybe not for a vendor tree, but for mainline, yes.

Ok.
A goal here would be to use serial8250_tx_dma() for these designs
(the delayed restore workaround makes that not possible right now though).

Agree; because if this problem is limited to the am335x then maybe
tx dma isn't worth doing for that design.

I'll test to see if disabling RDI eliminates the UART_IIR_NO_INT spurious
interrupts.

Let's confirm with the Intel folks that this is true, which would argue
for using the omap-style rx dma flow.

Slight misunderstanding; what I mean is what TI designs can actually use
serial8250_tx_dma()?

Right now, it seems both am335x and dra7 require omap_8250_tx_dma
(for the delayed_restore workaround and the direct write to tx fifo to
kick tx dma).

[ Assume that the UART_CAP_RPM functionality is added to serial8250_tx_dma() ]

Same misunderstanding but I get what you're saying; to your knowledge
all the TI designs require the omap-style rx dma transaction flow
(ie., submit transaction before data is received, and resubmit with each
completed transaction).

One thing that I wonder about then is the initial condition when
the port is first opened; what if data is being received then?
