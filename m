The pinctrl change in this patch and the wake-up events are a separate
issue.

As some omaps need the RX pin remuxed temporarily to GPIO for wake-up
events, the $subject patch seems just fine to me.

For the wake-up interrupts, the issue Thomas was concerned was
re-entrant interrupts and  handling the wake-up interrupts in various
different ways. From hardware point of view the wake-up events behave
like a separate IRQ controller, so the request_irq part is fine.

The wake-irq is disabled during runtime and should be enabled so
that should not be an issue.

Yeah I'll repost the patches for the generic wake-irq handling.
Fixing up the drivers to use that is trivial once we've agreed on
the generic wake-up event handling.
