This is a complete pointless test. Use a bog standard 8250 UART on the
PC and connect a microcontroller on the other end which serves you an
continous stream of data at 115200 Baud.

There is no way you can keep up with that without the low latency
option neither on old and nor on new machines if you have enough other
stuff going on in the system.
