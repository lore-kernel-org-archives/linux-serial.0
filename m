Sure will do for the next rev, sorry forgot to add that.

Good point, sounds like we need to do this in some pm_runtime
function directly for the locking.

Well right now it's using threaded irq, and I'd like to get rid of
the pm_runtime calls in the regular driver interrupts completely.
We need to ensure the device runtime_resume is completed before
returning IRQ_HANDLED here.

I'll verify again, but I believe the issue was that without doing
mark_last_busy here the device falls back asleep right away.
That probably should be fixed in pm_runtime in general if that's
the case.

Considering the above, should we add a new function something like
pm_resume_complete() that does not need irq_safe set but does
not return until the device has completed resume?

I think that would be pretty much probably just pm_request_resume
+ pm_runtime_barrier.

OK sure.

OK that's a good idea. Then we can drop dev_pm_wakeirq_arm_for_suspend()
and make that part automatic.

Then for runtime_pm, we could make the toggling of the wakeirq handling
automatic too. Or do you see a problem with that?

Well I was trying to keep it out of the way for most drivers not needing
to use wakeirqs. I'll take a look at making it a pointer in the struct
wakeup_source.
