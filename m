Sorry John, the reasoning is that I'm trying to understand
why this does not look like soft or hard lock-up or RCU stall
scenario.

The CPU which spins on prb_lock() can have preemption disabled and,
additionally, can have local IRQs disabled, or be under RCU read
side lock. If consoles are busy, then there are CPUs which printk()
data and keep prb_lock contended; prb_lock() does not seem to be
fair. What am I missing? You probably talk about the case when all
printing CPUs are in preemptible contexts (assumingly this is what
is happening in dm-integrity case) so they can spin on prb_lock(),
that's OK. The case I'm talking about is - what if we have the same
situation, but then one of the CPUs printk()-s from !preemptible.
Does this make sense?
