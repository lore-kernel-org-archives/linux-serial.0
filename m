No, this was not the comment's intent.

Yes this is one of the issues to be worked around.

This approach as you say has issues.  This is solved in different ways for modems.

<sleep>My observation is modem software which many talk over ppp over ip over serial of some sort (might be uart, might be usb), will send a command to the modem to go into a low power mode. Now you can cut clocks with out hurting modem and getting SOC power.

<wake>When some event happens at modem or processor (timer near beacon or other) the modem or apps processor can signal the other with some wake event (maybe over gpio) which then puts system in a state where it can receive data in trusted manner.

The modem channel driver try's to inform kernel about entering/exiting modes to set expectation.

No character was dropped in modem example.  On the UART-to-Debug console it may be ok to drop a character.  Ether needs a coordination hook.

Each stack needs some way to adjust expectations.  Finding a way to isolate to a sub-layer of stack and not break everything is always the quest.

This looks like a different issue.  Years back with custom kernels with lots of hacks hack this was not the case.  These days the job is harder to make it work more generally.  Evolving for PM tradeoffs is painful in HW and SW.
