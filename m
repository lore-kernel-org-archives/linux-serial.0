I'm not totally convinced that sharing minor allocation is the right
solution. ISTM that the main goal is for at least one serial driver
to represent ttyS (assuming that it is a suitable work-alike to the
8250 driver) while other ttyS serial drivers must still be able to
load and operate.

So for example, a UART that is ttyS in a typical configuration, might
be ttyX when another driver has been configured as ttyS instead.
Assuming that every uart driver has a unique, alternate base name,
then the problem is reduced to selecting the appropriate driver for
ttyS.

Some use cases would require selecting the ttyS driver at build time.
Others would probably require the notion of a preferred driver.

What got me thinking about this approach instead of sharing minor
allocation was based on the 'first-come, first-served' question
I asked back in Dec. What happens when probe order varies and
console=ttyS0/login prompt doesn't show up where it's supposed to?
I've had this experience with multiple ethernet adapters and it's
not fun.
