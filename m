This calculation is true, but we have to take into account there is a
hole in the middle, between AHB3, and APB1 register:

AHB1RSTR : offset = 0x10, index = 0
AHB2RSTR : offset = 0x14, index = 1
AHB3RSTR : offset = 0x18, index = 2
<HOLE >     : offset = 0x1c, index = 3
APB1RSTR : offset = 0x20, index = 4
APB2RSTR : offset = 0x24, index = 5

So we have to carefully document this hole in the bindings, maybe by
listing indexes in the documentation?

I will check other chips, to see if this is valid generally.

Thanks for your feedback,
