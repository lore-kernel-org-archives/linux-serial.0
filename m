This doesn't help understand what exactly is not working.  This needs
to be debugged further to understand the root cause.

A quick glance at the oops shows a fault when accessing a *physical*
address within the INTC.  The MMU is enabled here, and HW accesss shoul=
d
be using a virtual address. =20

Also, early in the boot there are a pile of other errors coming from th=
e
clock framework suggesting that this kernel has some other basic
problems as well.

I understand, but the point is that this approach is still the same as
the previous hack (check for UART wakeup on *every* wakeup event.)

What is needed is to further investigate using SW triggered IRQs can be
done for these wakeup events so we can get away from the above approach
all together.
