Is it somehow different from the basic 8250 driver on OMAP2? I've been 
struggling to figure out why my N810's GPS isn't working when I change kernels 
(I've already made sure ttyS0 is the correct major/minor and adjusted the GPIO 
calls; gpiodriver is talking to the chip, but not getting anywhere).
