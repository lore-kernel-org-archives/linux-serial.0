Yes. The idea is to be independent of the bootloaders for mux settings.

Now, in this change only the RX pin is configured. So if some board use=
s
omap_serial_init then only the RX is going to be configured.
How will they configure the rest of the pins?
They cannot call omap_serial_init_port after this just to configure the
rest of the mux pins( cts, rts, tx).

So data which is passed from omap_serial_init should have the
configuration
for all the pins, and this default data should be consistent across
atleast
some boards, so that they can use this. This will reduce the data
duplication across board files.

If this is not true, then all the pads can be configured from the board
files itself using omap_serial_init_port and you can set the required
RX wakeup capability there as well.
