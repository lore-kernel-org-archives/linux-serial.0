But looking into it UART_LSR_TEMT("include/linux/serial_reg.h") =3D> 0x=
40

from omap trm:

TX_SR_E =3D> bit 6
"Read 0x1: Transmitter hold (TX FIFO) and shift registers are empty."

So it means all data from tx fifo has shifted out and no pending data i=
n
tx fifo.

But we had used UART_LSR_THRE (0x20) here for tx fifo emptiness compari=
son
then  from omap trm

TX_FIFO_E =3D> bit 5

"Read 0x1: Transmit hold register (TX FIFO) is empty.
The transmission is not necessarily complete"

So I think all data has been shifted out from tx fifo for
serial_omap_tx_empty check.

Please post out this part as a patch,
I think this change has to go through linux-omap tree.
