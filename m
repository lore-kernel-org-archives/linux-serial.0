Done. I've kept the RX workarounds in the 8250_dma and moved the TX
part into the omap driver.
I needed to add the 8250_core pieces of patch #10 [0]. Now If you say,
couldn't this done in an other way then I could move the RX workarounds
pieces to the omap driver as well as the interrupt routine. Any
preferences?
