To add to this, my initial thought has been to split off uart_port ops
for use by the uart bus/subsystem so we can reuse all the uart
drivers. Then driver ports can be registered either with the tty layer
or the uart bus (or perhaps registered with both and claimed by one
later). This is somewhat already done with the serio subsys (see
drivers/tty/serial/sunsu.c). I thought extending serio might be an
option, but it's data handling is pretty limited.

The transmit side seems pretty straightforward. The receive side is a
bit more complex as the buffering is all in the tty layer. It doesn't
seem so straightforward to share the tty buffer handling code. Perhaps
at least initially, a more simple buffering scheme can be used given
the packet oriented nature of the device protocols.
