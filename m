Ok, and are you sure that your processor can even do something like
this?  Where is the time being spent when you make these calls?  A read
function should never hit the hardware, only retrieving data from a
buffer in memory, so if your processor can go this fast, it should be
fine.

Have you done profiling to determine exactly what it taking "too long"
for you?  If so, what is the delay?  If not, you should do this :)

Do you have a pointer to the driver anywhere?  Why isn't it submitted
for inclusion in the main kernel tree?
