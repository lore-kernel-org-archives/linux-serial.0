For the most cases, where there is a clock gate just before the 
peripheral it looks pretty much like the reset driver and I use the bit 
offset of the clock gating bit as the index.

However there are a couple of clocks without gating just before the 
clock reaches the peripheral:

1. A hard coded /8. I think this will have to be given a synthetic
    number.

2. Ungated dividers. For these I am using the bit offset of the LSB of
    the mux field.

So I think there is only one value that is completely unrelated to the 
hardware and will use a magic constant instead.

I had planned to macros similar to the STM32F4_AxB_RESET() family of 
macros in both clk driver and DT in order to reuse the bit layouts from 
dt-bindings/mfd/stm32f4-rcc.h .

Normal case would have looked like this:

		timer3: timer@40000000 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-timer";
			reg = <0x40000000 0x400>;
			interrupts = <28>;
			resets = <&rcc STM32F4_APB1_RESET(TIM3)>;
			clocks = <&rcc STM32F4_APB1_CLK(TIM3)>;
			status = "disabled";
		};

Without the macros it looks like this:

		timer3: timer@40000000 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-timer";
			reg = <0x40000000 0x400>;
			interrupts = <28>;
			resets = <&rcc 257>;
			clocks = <&rcc 513>;
			status = "disabled";
		};

However we could perhaps be more literate even if we don't use the macros?

		timer3: timer@40000000 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-timer";
			reg = <0x40000000 0x400>;
			interrupts = <28>;
			resets = <&rcc ((0x20*8) + 1)>;
			clocks = <&rcc ((0x40*8) + 1)>;
			status = "disabled";
		};
