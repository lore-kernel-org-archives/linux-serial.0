It throws a oops as here

Reproduced with below [EXP-1] change + below kernel.

[Has uart runtime patches based on pm-core branch]

Now with runtime changes we are cutting clocks independently
whereas prior to this we where cutting clocks only in sram_idle path.

With runtime changes:
1.) Once we cut uart clocks and send a char to uart it directs wakeup_i=
rq to
prcm_irq_handler the one way to wakeup uart from there was to check
uart mod wakeup status bits if wakeup event occurred then wakeup the
particular uart.
2.) Moving this resume back to sram path will break module wakeup after
uart clocks are disabled(using put_sync)

Thats the reason I have moved this to prcm_irq path to ensure
once auto-suspend happens after inactivity period we have resume_call
to wakeup uart port.
