Hi, Mark:
Based on your suggestion, we define a new sturct timer_info to let
timer driver record the value
of cycle-count-offset and cycle-count-down in timer_init function. The
above code in timer driver
is validate only when CONFIG_NDS32 is defined.

For alignment issue, we intentionally make an un-alignment read to
access this region and we
got "Segmentation fault" as expected.
