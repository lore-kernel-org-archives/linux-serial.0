CDAC is a shadow register used for monitoring the DMA channel.
 I think it would be a lot
simpler if omap_start_dma() always resets CDAC to 0, and the UART drive=
r
just not set it explicitly.

Simple wrapper APIs doing get / set on individual DMA registers is as
difficult to understand
as omap_read / omap_write, IMHO.
