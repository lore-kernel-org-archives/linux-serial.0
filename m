Yes, we can config it to write-back or write-through.

No, we don't support it.

We don't support SMP and the device will access memory through bus. I
think the cache is not shared.

We currently don't have such kind of SoC memory map.

Yes, it is always the same unless the CPU uses local memory. The
physical address of local memory will overlap the original bus
address.
I think the local memory case can be ignored because we don't use it for now.

> - are there devices that can only see a subset of the physical memory?
All devices are able to see the whole physical memory in our current
SoC, but I think other SoC may support such kind of HW behavior.

No.

Yes, there are write-buffers in front of CPU caches but it should be
transparent to SW. We don't need to flush it.

No.
