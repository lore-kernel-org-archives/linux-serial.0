I am planning to remove kconfig options, and add static mode values in =
platform
data for uart port dma mode usage for an given uart port.

Any given uart port can be configured to work in DMA or non dma
mode based on the board configuration, and decision has to be made by
developer itself (based on performance etc..) and should not rely on us=
er.

What do you say?

Providing bootarg option is easy, I'll add support if insisted.

IMHO static setting in platform data will do.
