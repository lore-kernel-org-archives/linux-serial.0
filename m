The point is that there is no platform specific Kconfig that could select
it, as the concept doesn't make a lot of sense here.

If you require the driver to always be selected by the
architecture code, it adds a little bit of bloat on systems
that don't need it. This is possible, but I think it's preferable
to give users a way of tuning a kernel for a particular chip.

I'm not worried about the driver bloating the kernel here when it
isn't disabled, this is no different from enabling the USB controller
by default for a board that doesn't have a USB connector, or
enabling ten different pinctrl drivers for all members of a chip
family even though you know which particular chip you are
running on.

Having a dependency on CONFIG_EXPERT means that a more
users will end up having to set that for a shipping system. It's
something we can do (even without a special Kconfig keyword),
but it should be used carefully for stuff that 99% of the users want
to enable.

Why not just:

config CLKSRC_ATCPIT100
       bool "Clocksource for AE3XX platform"
       depends on NDS32 || COMPILE_TEST
       depends on HAS_IOMEM
       default NDS32
       help
         This option enables support for the Andestech AE3XX platform timers.

That way, it's simply enabled on NDS32 by default, but just as easy
to disable for systems that don't need it.
