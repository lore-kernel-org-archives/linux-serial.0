ok fine, I will I incorporate initialize all uarts patch for zoom board=
s.

Are you referring to this patch?
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/108066/

Is this still needed if we have initialized all uarts?
This patch might not needed if we have initialized all uarts right?

Yes Sure,

Just FYI this patch series was also tested on omap2,3,4.
