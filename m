Hi all,

Here's an attempt to have Linux generic wakeirq helpers. This allows
removing most of the related code from drivers. Currently the drivers
all do it in a slightly different way. And may have issues with interrupt
re-entrancy and getting the suspend/resume vs runtime_pm wake handling
right.

This is for wakerirqs that are available for some devices in addition
to the regular device interrupts. The seprate always-on wake-up interrupt
controller is needed to allow devices and the SoC to enter deeper idle
states and still be able to wake-up to events.

Some of this was discussed in the kernel/irq context a while back [1].
But it seems that this can be done in drivers/base/power. If somebody has
hardware that needs to replay lost device interrupts based on the
wake-up interrupts, then additional kernel/irq changes will be needed.

This set fixes up three drivers to use the generic wakeirq. Note that
eventually the wakeirq handling for these drivers might end up in a
bus specific code and could be hidden away from the drivers.

Regards,

Tony
