The driver should not look at the resources of its children, just
register a range of addresses dynamically, as I suggested in an
earlier review.


Your current version has

        if (arm64_extio_ops->pfout)                             \
                arm64_extio_ops->pfout(arm64_extio_ops->devpara,\
                       addr, value, sizeof(type));             \

Instead, just subtract the start of the range from the logical
port number to transform it back into a bus-local port number:

        if (arm64_extio_ops->pfout)                             \
                arm64_extio_ops->pfout(arm64_extio_ops->devpara,\
                       addr - arm64_extio_ops->start, value, sizeof(type)); \

We know that the ISA/LPC bus can only have up to 65536 ports,
so you can register all of those, or possibly limit it further to
1024 or 4096 ports, whichever matches the bus implementation.
