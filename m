I'm not conviced (yet) that a mismatch is the root cause.  Yes, that's
what the author of $SUBJECT patch assumed and stated, but I'm not
pursuaded.  

If it's an improperly configured mux issue, then the UART will break
whenever the device is actually omap_device_enable'd, whether in the
driver or in the bus layer.
