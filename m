That raise the question about using DT to pass linux specific parameter.
We already discuss that on the mailing list, but never get a clear answer.
It seems that DT is already used to provide some OS specific information 
using the "linux," prefix for example.

There are clearly a couple of parameters that can be provided by the 
bootloader, but that does not reflect a HW property.

So what is the guideline for that, should we stick to cmdline params for 
that?

Quoting Grant's documentation, runtime configuration is supported:

"Runtime configuration

In most cases, a DT will be the sole method of communicating data from 
firmware to the kernel, so also gets used to pass in runtime and 
configuration data like the kernel parameters string and the location of 
an initrd image.

Most of this data is contained in the /chosen node, and when booting 
Linux it will look something like this:

	chosen {
		bootargs = "console=ttyS0,115200 loglevel=8";
		initrd-start = <0xc8000000>;
		initrd-end = <0xc8200000>;
	};

The bootargs property contains the kernel arguments, and the initrd-* 
properties define the address and size of an initrd blob. The chosen 
node may also optionally contain an arbitrary number of additional 
properties for platform-specific configuration data."


Does that mean that this is supported only if the bootloader does not 
support cmdline?

Thanks,
Benoit
