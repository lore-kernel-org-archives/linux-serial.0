No, unlike the PCI memory space, the PIO addresses are not
usually distinct, i.e. every PCI bus has its own 64K I/O
addresses starting at zero. We linearize them into the
Linux I/O space using the per-domain io_offset value.

For the ISA/LPC spaces there are only 4k of addresses, they
the bus addresses always overlap, but we can trivially
figure out the bus address from Linux I/O port number
by subtracting the start of the range.

It would clearly be a rather invasive change, but the
end-result isn't necessarily more complex than what we
have today, as we'd kill off the crazy pci_pio_to_address()
and pci_address_to_pio() hacks in address translation.

I said having a single domain is fine, but I still don't
like the idea of reserving low port numbers for this hack,
it would mean that the numbers change for everyone else.

I liked the idea of having it done in asm-generic/io.h (in an ifdef)
and lib/*.c under an as someone suggested earlier. There is nothing
ARM64 specific in the implementation.
