Here are 3 cases:
1) out-of-band interrupt (usually GPIO) which can be wake source;
2) in-band interrupt (have not seen this for UART, though it's supported
by tty framework for a long time AFAIU);
3) special case when Out-of-band interrupt uses the pin in UART pool of
pins.

We are talking here about case 3).

As you remember it has not (the ugly hack which is used right now is not
correct implementation of RPM).

See above, in case 3) we would be able to achieve that when pin mode is
switched to GPIO and back. I don't remember if OMAP uses this approach.

I think this one is not related to case 3).

This is not needed if you use DT or ACPI and framework (serial in this
case) checks for interrupt correctly.
