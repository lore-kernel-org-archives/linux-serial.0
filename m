I think selecting PCIBIOS_MIN_IO as the separator of mapped and non-mapped I/O
range probably is not so reasonable.
PCIBIOS_MIN_IN is specific to PCI devices, it seems as the recommended minimal
start I/O address when assigning the pci device I/O region. It is probably not
defined in some platforms/architectures when no PCI is needed there. That is why
my patch caused some compile error on some archs;

But more important thing is that the PCIBIOS_MIN_IO has different value on
different platforms/architectures. On Arm64, it is 4K currently, but in other
archs, it is not true. And the maximum LPC I/O address should be 64K
theoretically, although for compatible ISA, 2K is enough.
So, It means using PCIBIOS_MIN_IO on arm64 can match our I/O reservation
require. But we can not make this indirectIO work well on other architectures.

I am thinking Arnd's suggestion. But I worry about I haven't completely
understood his idea. What about create a new bus host for LPC/ISA whose I/O
range can be 64KB? This LPC/ISA I/O range works similar to PCI host bridge's I/O
window, all the downstream devices under LPC/ISA should request I/O from that
root resource. But it seems Arnd want this root resource registered dynamically,
I am not sure how to do...

Anyway, if we have this root I/O resource, we don't need any new macro or
variable for the LPC/ISA I/O reservation.

Hope my thought is right.

Best,
Zhichang
