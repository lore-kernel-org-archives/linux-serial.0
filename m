If you want to change this to reduce the gap, then you have first
change 8250 core code. Currently it waits until the shift register is
empty.
On the other hand if you use DMA then it can handle transfers > 64bytes
in one go and you can start transfers while the FIFO is not completely
empty.

If you use DMA. You program one transfer says 100 bytes. You get an
dma-transfer complete once the 100 bytes are transfered which means the
=46IFO has 63 bytes. From this point on you could enqueue the next
transfer with say another 100 bytes. In that scenario you don't see the
gap.

You get only to the gap if you use the non-DMA mode (and not UARTs
support DMA). In that case, yes waiting till there only 16 bytes before
starting the refill would make sense if you want to utilize the port by
100%. But as I said in 0/15, you need to teach the core this first.
Otherwise it will return doing nothing until the shift register is
empty (i.e. until the FIFO is completely empty).

There is patch in Greg's tty tree already where you are able to
configure the RX trigger level. We could wire this up once we agree
which levels we want support. The OMAP supports all levels from 1=E2=80=
=A663.

Yes, true. However this is only an issue without HW control. With DMA
the buffer is slightly larger. The DMA engine starts the transfer on
its own once there 48 bytes in the FIFO (except in the few cases where
it does not).
