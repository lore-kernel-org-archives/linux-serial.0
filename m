Nope. I think it should be platform_data and should be possible to over=
ride
vith a kernel cmdline option. That's because we support compiling in an=
d
booting many boards the same kernel binary.

How about set some kernel cmdline options if you want to override the
default settings?

Or can be changed from kernel cmdline if necessary.
