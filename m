Also this is change will be removed and default serial_pad
reg will have proper values for .enable and .idle fields using
which it will muxed accordingly

Agree omap-device level api to pad wakeup check is better.

Module level wakeup doesn't seem to work and only
way it seem to wakeup is through using resume_idle
from sram_idle.

One simple way to reproduce the problem with
existing code base also is adding this patch which
will enable module level wakeup always.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/501211/

and with below change.

We can see module level wakeup doesn't wakeup the uart.
once we set sleep_timeout for uart and timer starts.
