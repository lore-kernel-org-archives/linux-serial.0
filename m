I managed to get something dma related on uart3.  But it isn't happy:

[   95.577401] DMA misaligned error with device 53
repeated many times.

I wonder if the dma support isn't quite working for the omap572x yet in
this tree (ti's 3.12.y tree), or maybe it is picky and the driver still
needs a bit of work.

I have had no issues on uart7 and 8 without dma.
