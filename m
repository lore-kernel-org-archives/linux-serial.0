Yes I would not be suprised if that same bug is in all of them though..

OK great :)

Looks like the paste bug is there for sure, doing off idle and pasting
240 characters to the console can hang the UART RX after few attempts,
and pasting 16 charactes won't show up at all if the system is idling.
So you may want to play with that too a bit :)
