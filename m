Thanks for the respin. I've just tested the series a bit. Here's some
things I ran into.

- Basic console use is better than the previous series. It behaves
  pretty much like the omap-serial implementation.

- ncurses based applications (vi, less) don't play nice for me on the
  console with this series. less doesn't show me anything. vi doesn't
  return to console properly.

- I seem seem to get stuck in a "serial8250: too much work for irq%d"
  loop somewhat reliably. We have a rather demanding application with
  typically somewhere between 600 and 1000 byte packets being sent at
  240Hz (roughly somewhere between 1.5 and 2 Mb/s). We run at baudrate
  3500k. I get into this "too much work" thing already when running at
  300 bytes per packet.

I hope this is of some use to you. I'll do more testing later.

Thanks,
Frans
