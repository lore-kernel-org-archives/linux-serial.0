Yep, I see no safe way to clear the spurious interrupt [1] and no idea how to
keep it from happening (other than via the unsolicited RX reads in
serial8250_do_startup).

Unfortunately, I think this means we'll have to revert Sebastian's commit:

    tty: serial: 8250_core: read only RX if there is something in the FIFO
    
which just means OMAP3630 will be limited to using the omap_serial driver.

[1]  To clear the RX timeout interrupt requires reading the rx fifo even though
LSR[data ready] indicates no data. However, this could result in dropped data
if the data became available just before clearing the RX timeout. For example,

 CPU                                 | Device
                                     |
 irq handler (simplified)            |
                                     |
   read IIR                          |
   is interrupt? yes                 |
   read LSR                          |
   is data ready? no                 |
   is IIR == Rx timeout? yes         | new data arrives
                                     | rx_fifo[0] = new data
                                     | lsr[data ready] = 1
   read RX and discard               |
                                     |
