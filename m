Agreed.

So what I thought about "mutual exclusive error reporting with
quadratic latencies" was that if any workload involves error
reporting then it might be a good idea to _not_ parallelize such
workload anymore.

Agreed.

I'm very skeptical about "serializing CPUs" part. It looks like one
"print or die trying" is replaced with another "print or die trying".
What happened to  log_store() + flush_on_panic()?
