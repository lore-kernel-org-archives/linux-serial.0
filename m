The omap-serial uart driver is designed to work either in interrupt
mode or in DMA mode,
We have provided this option so that one can select interrupt mode or
DMA mode based on the uart usage, if somebody is using uart as console
then interrupt mode will do, else if used with bluetooth which does
huge data transfer then DMA mode can be selected.

Don't you think this should be a configurable option using kconfig
rather than passing as platform data?

if used as platform data then one has to modify platform data to
switch between the interrupt and DMA mode.
