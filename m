Hmmm. The DRA7x was using pause before for UART. I just did not see it
coming that it was not allowed here. John made a similar change to the
edma driver and I assumed it went stable but now I see that it was just
cherry-picked into the ti tree.
If you are not comfortable it being stable material I can drop it.

Ah. So I forgot to increment the counter. A few lines above there is
the same loop as a workaround for something. This is the same loop. I
could merge the loop + warning if you prefer. to have those things in
one place. I could also just increment i. Merging the two loops might
be better.

While that would work, too I think it is more explicit to the reader if
you check for the condition that is important to you.
