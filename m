If the messages from this report are not critical, they should not be
classified as emergency messages. It is a bug if they are.

Sure. But it is important to distinguish if these messages are critical
or just informational.

If these are critical messages, then we are _not allowed to drop any_!
For critical messages printk must be synchronous. Thus for critical
messages the situation you illustrated is appropriate.

Let us not forget, it deadlocked the machine. That's the reason this
thread exists.

In this example it turned it into a brick.

The problems I see are:

1. The current loglevels used in the kernel are not sufficient to
   distinguish between emergency and informational messages. Addressing
   this issue may require things like using a new printk flag and
   manually marking the printks that we(?) decide are critical. I was
   hoping we could use existing loglevels, but this appears to be such a
   mess that it is probably not practically/politically fixable
   [0]. Maybe it could be a combination of flag and loglevel, where
   certain messages have been flagged by the kernel developers as
   emergency (for example BUG output) and the user still has the
   flexibility of setting a loglevel. I need more input here.

2. You seem unwilling to acknowledge the difference between emergency
   and informational messages. A message is either critical or it is
   not. If it is, it should be handled as such, regardless of
   interference, regardless if it means turning an SMP machine into a UP
   machine. If it is not critical, it should be sent along a
   non-interfering path so the the system is _not_ affected.

The current printk implementation is handling all console printing as
best effort. Trying hard enough to dramatically affect the system, but
not trying hard enough to guarantee success.
