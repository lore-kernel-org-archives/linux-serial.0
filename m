The oneshot fix, fixed it for me :-)

We have encountered another problem regarding flow control in this driver.
Flowcontrol simply gets deactivated right after it's activated :-(
My college will submit a patch, hopefully in a couple of days...

And the "sc16is7xx_get_mctrl() is invoked under the uart port spinlock" 
problem is still there but with RT patches it's hidden.
