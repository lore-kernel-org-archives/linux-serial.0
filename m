I think the correct way to "inform the kernel" would be with the 'CREAD'
c_cflag in termios.  Clearing it indicates that we don't expect to read whi=
ch
would allow the UART to go to sleep.
When the GPIO interrupt arrives, we would use termios to set CREAD and then
start talking to the modem.

However it is easy to imagine situations where this wouldn't be enough.
A fairly obvious way to wake a sleeping serial connection is with a 'break'.
I have a GPS which can be put to sleep and then woken by sending a 'break'.
Similarly the OMAP uart can reliably receive a break when asleep, but cannot
reliably receive any other input.

Though maybe if BRKINT is set in c_iflag, then we could still receive a bre=
ak
even when CREAD is clear.  Then clearing CREAD would be enough to allow
low-power mode.

it may be ok to drop a character.  Ether needs a coordination hook.

I don't think it is really OK to drop chars on the UART-to-Debug console.
However it is OK to drop the BAUD rate to 57600 where we can wake up in time
for to catch the first bit.  So if you want power saving, drop the console
buad rate.

So I would suggest:
 - remove the autosuspend timeouts
 - allow runtime_pm to shutdown the device when it is not open, or when
   rate is 57600 or below, or when 'CREAD' is clear
 - keep runtime_pm active whenever there are bytes in the output queue or
   fifo

The only case that wouldn't support is when a device will wake up the SOC by
sending a non-break character which it is OK to receive corrupted.  The tty
would have to be in !CREAD for that to happen, and then there would be no w=
ay
for the app to know that a non-break character was received.
Would it be reasonable to treat any input while CREAD is clear as a break?
