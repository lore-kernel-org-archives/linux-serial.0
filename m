For h/w flow control, you need to check if the CTS and RTS signals are
being brought out to the serial header on the beagle-board. Looking at
the schematics for the 3430 beagle board, it appears that only the UART
RX and TX signals are available on the serial header. Therefore, I don't
believe you can test h/w flow control using the console with that board.

I do see that you can access all the UART2 signals (RX/TX/CTS/RTS) via
the expansion connector on the beagle. However, to connect to a serial
port on a PC you need to have a voltage level-shifter in-between. There
are some companies out there that make them [1], but you need to make
sure you have one that can support a 1.8V input.

Cheers
Jon
