Yes correct, its about where exactly to do hwmod_idle for
avoiding hmwod_reset/idle from boot up.

I did some study into the approaches you suggested,
Below are my observation, Please correct me if I missed out
any thing in my below observation,

same activate func gets called for all uarts, how to determine the
activate func. was called for first time for the given uart.

(use od->pdev->dev.name strcmp with uart name for first name
and maintain a state machine ? confused)

Then should we have different activate funcs?

bus_register_notifier is for all drivers within the bus,
omap-uart is registered as platform bus and there a lot more
devices that register under platform bus,

So registering the notifier for platform bus will call notifier
for all probes withing platform bus,

Is there a way to have notifier per device or given device?

Since bus notifier seems to be notify for all devices
registered within the given bus.
