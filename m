-ENODEV is the appropriate return from the probe(); there is no device.
That returning that value doesn't make sense from devm_ioremap_resource
is simply a reflection of the awkward construct.

Trying to argue that a missing host bus window is an "invalid argument"
to probe() is just trying to make the shoe fit.

None of the devm_ioremap_resource() changes have been submitted for
serial drivers. I see no problem with accepting the Spreadtrum driver
as is, and if someone wants to do a massive changeset to rework the
platform_get_resource()/devm_ioremap_resource() idiom for serial drivers
for 3.21, then the Spreadtrum driver would be included then.

That said, I'd prefer to see that idiom wrapped in a single function
rather than what's being suggested.
