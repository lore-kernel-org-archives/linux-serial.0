Today we could get console_uart booted with irq_patches + uart_runtime
shared by Avinash [Irq_chaining + some local hacks, still not clean pat=
ches]

But AFAIK looks like still soft irq method is not generic as we dont
have any similar mechanism for omap4 so how to keep it consistent.

So Shall we retain resume method until we have a generic approach ?
