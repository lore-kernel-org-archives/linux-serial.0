I have fixed this and other uart_v7 comments and have re-based the
patch series on top
of 3.2-rc1 along with Tero's v9 irq chaining patches and tested the sam=
e.
Available here [1].

Can this patches series be added to a test branch for upstreaming or do=
 you
think there are still some outstanding comments that needs to be discus=
sed?
