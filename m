Am sorry to say that I had to drop the code changes from this patch, due 
to the OMAP serial bugs addressed by these two patches:

    http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.omap/84729
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg196034.html

Without those two patches, OMAP4430ES2 Panda crashes after Tero's patches 
are applied, with the same symptom as with the N800 crash.  Applying 
those two patches fixes the problem.

It would be good if you guys could ask Greg to pick up the first patch 
ASAP so we can queue the second one during the early 3.7-rc time frame.
