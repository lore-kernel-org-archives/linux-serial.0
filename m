Well, it is both really, but I guess OF_DECLARE_ linker sections are
just an implementation detail of scattering various explicit init
calls. My concern is we'll end up with another initcall like mechanism
and the ordering problems associated with them. For example, what if
another platform needs clocks initialized before the reset controller?
I could see wanting to add gpio, pinctrl, syscon, etc. Another example
is the Beagleboard Cape folks want to read an I2C EEPROM early to
apply overlays before drivers probe. Where do we draw the line?

I have the same position that it is the exception, not the rule, so
use the machine descriptor. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but
I think these cases need to be questioned.
