OK, I see now.

Here's why:

The difference is the powerdomain that the console UART is on for these
boards.  UART1,2 are in CORE, UART2/3 are in PER.   SDP uses UART1 (CORE),
Zoom3 doesn't use OMAP UARTs at all, and Beagle uses UART3 (PER).

Due to a HW sleepdep between MPU and CORE, MPU will not transition until
CORE does, which means MPU will not transition until UART 1 & 2 are
idle.

On Beagle, the console is ttyO2 (UART3) which is in PER, and since the
MPU is free to transition independently of PER, that is what is
happening, resulting in slower response time on for any boards that have
PER-UART consoles.

Yes, but obviously comes at the expense of power savings.  IOW, This is
a hard-coded power vs. performance trade off that we are trying to get
away from.

So, the root of the problem is that the MPU wakeup latency is causing a
"sluggish" console.  The solution?  request an MPU wakeup latency
constraint.

This is a classic use-case for such a constraint, and the serial driver
should have the option of requesting a constraint to prevent the sluggish
console.  The constraint only needs to be held until the auto-suspend
delay expires, so should be relased in the ->runtime_suspend() method of
the driver.

This constraint needs to be configurable, probably from the board file,
so that it is optional, and so users who don't care about sluggish
consoles (or non-console UART users who don't care about response time)
have the option of preferring power savings over UART responsiveness.

As a reference, the i2c driver is currently doing something similar 
in that it request an MPU constraint to prevent the MPU from going into
retention/off while waiting for an i2c interrupt to arrive.
