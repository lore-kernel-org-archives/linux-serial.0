I think the consensus is to leave the low_latency facility in, but
remove it's connection to the tty buffers.

If the known-to-be-already-in-non-interrupt-context drivers want,
I can add a different function for executing flush_to_ldisc()
directly. But I don't want to do that without a use-case and test
subject.

Oh. That's not something I want to take on.

That was my thought too -- that only dependency injection would work.
Which would require adding that to most, if not all, driver methods, which
seems way too painful.

Right.

Based on my recent test, I think low_latency doesn't need to be a knob for
the tty core. Drivers can continue to use it to mess with their rx fifo
settings and such like.

I plan on sending Greg a patch to do just that, probably this weekend.
