Cute, but ...

__tty_buffer_flush() can call tty_buffer_free() which in turn can call
kfree(), which is a nono on RT with preemption and interrupts
disabled. Enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP and extensive testing
should have told you that.

I did not look at the other places where this lock is used, but I
suspect there is more fallout lurking.
