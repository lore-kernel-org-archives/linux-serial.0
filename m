descriptors, yes.

The point is to check (later, after terminate_all()) if there is an
outstanding DMA transfer or not _and_ how much data was really
transfered. Looking at edma it does not really support the latter if
the transfer is already completed. On the plus side the HW does not
support partly transfers :)

But where is it written that the life time of the cookie is limited?
Looking at the "cooking check" code there is no such thing. It is
simply compare of completed vs passed number but okay, this is an
implementation detail.
=46rom [0] it says under "4. Submit the transaction":

| This returns a cookie can be used to check the progress of DMA engine
| activity via other DMA engine calls not covered in this document.

no life time limit mentioned here. Which brings to the question: Why is
it okay to use the cookie after the transaction "terminated" normally
but not if it has been canceled?

And from [0] the API explanation  "4. =E2=80=A6 dma_async_is_tx_complet=
e()":

So the documentation says to use the cookie with
dma_async_is_tx_complete() and before doing so it is recommended that
the transfer should be paused or stopped. _Exactly_ what is done here.

In the RX interrupt (of the 8250 unit), the code checks if the transfer
has been already started or not via querying the status. So if it
returns DMA_COMPLETE then a new transfer will be started. If it returns
DMA_IN_PROGRESS then the code returns doing nothing because the DMA
engine should start moving data anytime now so the RX interrupt goes
away.

That means: If the transfer is canceled then it won't be started again.

Btw: the current (probably only) dma driver that is used by 8250-dma is
dw/core.c. That one does cookie complete on terminate:
 dwc_control(DMA_TERMINATE_ALL) -> dwc_descriptor_complete() ->
 dma_cookie_complete().

That is why it works for them=E2=80=A6
