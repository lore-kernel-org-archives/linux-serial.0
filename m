Yes correct, Looks like the poll rate is to aggressive
it should be calculated based on baud rate provided from user apace
in termios function.

I had a patch to do the same in termios but,
if you have something similar you can post out as I am currently busy w=
ith
some other activities and may take more time.

I remember doing similar excercise with BT + uart on zoom board
but performance numbers where impacted.

I made buffer size as 1 byte and removed polling function and got rx_ca=
llback
for every byte completion and pushed same to tty layer.

BT FTP throughput got impacted a lot.

Thanks,
Govindraj.R

note: I little busy currently and replies might be delayed.
         sorry for any inconvenience.
