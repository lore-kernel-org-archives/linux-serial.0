Correct the composition

Dear Arnd:

1. Setup an additional memory mapping for clock hardware in user space
when establishing vdso-needed memory mapping
     In arch_setup_additional_pages(), kernel establishes memory
mapping for vdso's text and vdata page in user space. In order to make
clock hardware be accessible in user space, we try to establish an
additional memory mapping for clock hardware here based on clock
information from driver. This page is located between vdata page and
vdso text page. For safety, this region for clock accessing is
read-only.

2. Accessing clock hardware in vdso
    After step 1, clock hardware is accessible in user space through
memory-mapped IO. However, it is not enough to access a specific
register. Therefore, we store register offset information in vdata
page to make it visible in user space.  Now, vdso can derive the
address of counter register by summation of __get_timerpage() and
counter register offset where __get_timerpage() is used to derive the
virtual address of memory-mapped clock.
