There were even serial boards that had a cooked "line mode" which
buffered up a whole line of input: they handled limited line-editing
and didn't interrupt the CPU until they saw 'enter' or 'ctrl-C'.

It might.  That depends on whether the driver paid any attention to
the low_latency flag.  IIRC, some did, some didn't.

Sure.  In pretty much all of the UARTs I know of, you can configure
the rx FIFO threshold or disable the rx FIFO altogether [though
setting the threshold to 1 is usually a better idea than disabling the
rx FIFO].  At least one of my serial_core drivers looks at the
low_latency flag and configure a lower rx FIFO threshold if it's set.

What specs?

Back in the old days, when a serial driver pushed characters up to the
tty layer it didn't immediately wake up a process that was blocking on
a read().  AFAICT, that didn't happen until the next system tick. I'm
not sure if that was just because the scheduler wasn't called until a
tick happened, or if there was some intermediate tty-layer
worker-thread that had to run.

Setting the low_latency flag avoided that.

When the driver pushed characters to the tty layer with the
low_latency flag set, the user-space process that was blocking on
read() would wake up "immediately". This potentially used up a lot
more CPU time, since a user process that is reading a large block of
data _might_ be woken up and then block again for every rx byte --
assuming no rx FIFO.  Without the low_latency flag, the user process
would wake up every 10ms and be handed 10ms worth of data.  (Back then
HZ was always 100.)

At least that's how I remember it...
