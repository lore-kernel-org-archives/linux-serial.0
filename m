New code introduced by commit bf9346f5d47b ("gpiolib: Identify arrays
matching GPIO hardware") forcibly tries to find an array member which
has its array index number equal to its hardware pin number and set
up an array info for possible fast bitmap processing of all arrray
pins belonging to that chip which also satisfy that numbering rule.

Depending on array content, it may happen that consecutive array
members which belong to the same chip but don't have array indexes
equal to their pin hardware numbers will be split into groups, some of
them processed together via the fast bitmap path, and rest of them
separetely.  However, applications may expect all those pins being
processed together with a single call to .set_multiple() chip callback,
like that was done before the change.

Limit applicability of fast bitmap processing path to cases where all
pins of consecutive array members starting from 0 which belong to the
same chip have their hardware numbers equal to their corresponding
array indexes.  That should still speed up processing of applications
using whole GPIO banks as I/O ports, while not breaking simultaneous
manipulation of consecutive pins of the same chip which don't follow
the equal numbering rule.
