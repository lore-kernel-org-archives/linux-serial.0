Except that currently when we add ranges to io_range_list we don't have
a bus number yet, because the parsing happens before the host bridge
has been created. Maybe register_io_range() can take a bus number as an
argument, but I'm not sure how we are going to use that in pci_pio_to_address()
or pci_address_to_pio().
