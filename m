My personal feeling is that as 0aa525d11859 was wrong, it should be
reverted and this should be another attempt to fix the problem.  In
other words, there should be two patches, one a revert of the previously
known bad commit and this one having another go at it.

I feel that would be a better approach, since then we don't end up
with this change building on a previously know buggy change.  It
would also make the changes to this solution from the previous,
known-to-work-for-decades code more obvious.
