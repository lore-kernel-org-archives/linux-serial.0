If we don't bypass the calling of pci_address_to_pio after 
of_translate_address,
there should no conflict between LPC logical IO range and other logical 
IO ranges
of other devices.
I guess Arnd want to skip all the translation for our LPC IO address. 
But if we do it
like that, it seems we can't avoid the possible conflict with the 
logical IO ranges of
PCI host bridges without any changes on the pci_register_io_range and 
pci_address_to_pio.
Because two completely separate I/O spaces are created without 
synchronization.
