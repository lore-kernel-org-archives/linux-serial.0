Ok.

I already have this in place for other drivers that I'm going to use
with the pci-amba bridge. They have already been picked up by Rusell,
but they are not in linux-next yet.  So maybe other people have more
errors than me related to sizes.h, but this for mmci is trivial with
the other stuff in place.

Ok for the rest, I'll submit a patch set following your suggestions
when the other sizes.h stuff reaches linux-next.
