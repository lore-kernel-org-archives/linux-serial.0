I see nothing wrong with the patch contents, but a few things regarding
the submission process:

- The 'Signed-off-by' lines are in the wrong order. As the person
  sending it, your S-o-b should be the last one in the list

- You have too many people on 'To'. Please send the patch only to
  the person you expect to apply it, and put the other people that
  may be interested on Cc. A lot of the people who got this mail
  are probably not interested and you can drop them completely.

- Now that everything is reviewed, split the series according to
  subsystem maintainers and send it separately: patches 1,2 and 5
  should go to GregKH as one series, the rest should go to
  'arm@kernel.org'.

- For some reason I did not get patch 4. Can you check if that
  made it to the mailing list?

Feel free to add my 'Acked-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>' to
the patches you send to Greg.
