It is true that this patch is not intending to configure the pads.

But my question is, after this patch say
   1) some board file calls omap_serial_port.
   2) As a result , all the uarts devices are build and only the Rx pad=
 is
configured for each device.
   3) After this there will be no way of configuring the rest of the pa=
ds
??
      That should not happen. Also relying that the bootloaders are goi=
ng
      to do the configuration is not correct.

      So if some board calls omap_serial_port then there should be defa=
ult
values for all pads which a board can use, otherwise the board calls
omap_serial_init_port for each of the device.
