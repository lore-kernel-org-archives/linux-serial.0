So now we take the console lock on *every* console write?  Even if the
device is not about to be idled?   This is rather over-protective, don't
you think?

The exact scenario for triggering this still not well described, and
thus still I don't get it.

I still don't fully understand this problem, but if it's isolated to
runtime suspending, maybe you need a console lock in the runtime_suspend
path (like you already have in the static suspend path.)

Assuming this was a printk, it's now lost, right?   Not sure that's an
acceptable solution.
