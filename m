I think this is effectively what we are doing so far with patch 2/3.
The problem with this patch is that we are carving out a "forbidden"
IO tokens range that goes from 0 to PCIBIOS_MIN_IO.

I think that the proper solution would be to have the LPC driver to
set the carveout threshold used in pci_register_io_range(), 
pci_pio_to_address(), pci_address_to_pio(), but this would impose
a probe dependency on the LPC itself that should be probed before
the PCI controller (or before any other devices calling these
functions...)

Ok many thanks I am going to look at it

Yes but
1) isn't the PCI controller range property that defines how IO bus address
   map into physical CPU addresses?
2) How can you guarantee that the cpu range associated with this
   IO bus range is the first to be registered in pci_register_io_range()?
   ( i.e. are you saying that they are just relying on the fact that it is the
     only IO range in the system and by chance the IO tokens and corresponding
     bus addresses are the same? )

Thanks
