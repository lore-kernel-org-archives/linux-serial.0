Why? Any IORESOURCE_IO address always refers to the logical I/O port
range in Linux, not the physical address that is used on a bus.

The start address is the offset: if you get an address between 'start'
and 'end', you subtract the 'start' from it, and use that to call
the registered driver function. That works because we can safely
assume that the bus address range that the LPC driver registers starts
zero.
