Vikram,

We do have an driver to support IrDA -- > drivers/net/irda/omap-ir.c

This is basically used to handle any change in uart line[cts,dcd],
like an change in status of cts line should be handled
which is done using the function by checking the MSR[modem status regis=
ter].

This timeout is the period where we except some activity on rx line as
we dont the time period we receive data hence we keep rx dma channel
active for minimum of 10 secs, however this can be reduced.
