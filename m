Yes, I think so.

I don't think there is even a problem with GENERIC_IOMAP: If both are
set, passing a low number as a pointer will turn an ioread32() into an
inl(), which is implemented by libio.

I think most of these architectures just use their own inb/outb functions,
and should not use libio at all.

It's also possible that they use an older way of mapping I/O ports by calling
ioremap() on the physical address and treating the pointer as a 32-bit
I/O port number (relying on the PCI_IOBASE=0 default). Architectures doing
that might have other issues with libio, and I wouldn't try converting those.

This seems fine.

Ok. Let's wait for Bjorn to reply on this idea before you spend too much time
on this though.
