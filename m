The majority doing the opposite does not mean it is right.

Do you know which clock belongs to which board ? Who will unselect a
clock ? I'm pretty sure nobody. Everyone relies on the platform Kconfig
and expect it to select the right drivers.

We don't expect the hackers to have a deep knowledge of the hardware and
the driver dependencies. It is very convenient to not care about that
and let the platform's Kconfig to select the right drivers.

And that is the behavior I would like to keep.

Yes, the result is the same, the option is not showed in the menu.

However, I can understand it could be interesting to have the ability to
unselect a driver for experts.

I'm wondering if we can create a bool_expert which shows up only when
CONFIG_EXPERT is set.
