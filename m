Temporarily I've kept things working for me by avoiding 
of_io_request_and_map() in the clock driver (I am using raw of_iomap() 
instead).

I view this as a hack rather than a solution!

Note that, with or without the hack, I do hope to be able to post the 
clock driver this weekend. I am acutely aware that at the moment we are 
discussing code I haven't posted yet.

I guess a driver doesn't *have* to reserve all the register space 
described in DT. The driver could replace of_io_request_and_map() with 
lower level calls.

Thus if we wanted to keep this detail out of DT then I guess the two 
drivers could simply make an agreement not to request registers they do 
not use.
