>From <<3.1.1. Open Firmware Properties for Bus Nodes>> in 
http://www.firmware.org/1275/bindings/isa/isa0_4d.ps

I quote:
"There shall be an entry in the "ranges" property for each
of the Memory and/or I/O spaces if that address space is
mapped through the bridge."

It seems to me that it is ok to have 1:1 address mapping and that
therefore of_translate_address() should fail if "ranges" is not
present.

This is also explained quite well in
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/of/address.c#L490

what do you think?

Thanks
