Well, this patch has the "advantage" of allowing the user to override
the config and create blank ports anyway.

That said, I'm exploring a completely different approach: I've split the
driver from the port operations. The idea being that the existing
"universal" driver supports everything it does now, while allowing for
a new driver(s) to only support a subset.

At this point, I've only done the actual split. So the "universal" driver
module has:
 * ISA/"serial8250" platform driver
 * PNP init
 * uart driver and console definitions
 * all the existing module parameters
 * all the globals (except the const uart_config[] table)
 * RSA port handling
 * Chained interrupt handling
 * port i/o by timer handling
 * early_serial_setup()
 * sun ttyS shared registration
 * serial8250_ports[] table and how it re-uses existing ports

The "universal" driver also has the sub-driver interface, which is:
 * serial8250_register_8250_port
 * serial8250_unregister_port
 * serial8250_suspend/resume_port
 * serial8250_find_port (hack for 8250_early)
 * serial8250_get_port (hack for runtime pm)

This interface is just storage and minor allocation, since the
port-reuse behavior will be limited to the "universal" driver.
>From a sub-driver perspective, the shared storage is actually
a hindrance, so that reduces the requirement to minor allocation.

And that's where I'm stuck at the moment -- how to share ttyS
minor allocation. ttyS console is a related problem.
