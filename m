Thank you for revewing so detailedly. :)

I will drop it. It must be added in earlier kernel version.

ok. I will drop it.

Yes, we would like to build a kernel with CPU_V3 to run on all of the above.

Not sure if these help texts clear enough?

          The data cache of N15/D15 is implemented as PIPT and it will
not cause the
          cache aliasing issue. The rest cpus(N13, N10 and D10) are
implemented as
          VIPT data cache. It may cause the cache aliasing issue if
its cache way
          size is larger than page size. You can specify the the CPU
type direcly or
          choose CPU_V3 if unsure.

          A kernel built for N10 is able to run on N15, D15, N13, N10 or D10.
          A kernel built for N15 is able to run on N15 or D15.
          A kernel built for D10 is able to run on D10 or D15.
          A kernel built for D15 is able to run on D15.
          A kernel built for N13 with CPU_CACHE_ALIASING is able to
run on N15, D15, N13, N10 or D10
          A kernel built for N13 without CPU_CACHE_ALIASING is able to
run on N15, N13 or D15

After reviewing this config, it seems to make much more sense if we
select CPU_CACHE_ALIASING.
A kernel with aliasing cache handling should be able to run on
aliasing/non-aliasing CPU.

config CPU_V3
        bool "AndesCore v3 compatible"
        select CPU_CACHE_ALIASING

I will set default to VMSPLIT_3G_OPT and delete
CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G_OPT=y in defconfig.
