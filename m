Good catch, thanks. However I wouldn't bet my money it that won't be
defined here. The semaphore code provides up() and down() so it is
makes it kind of defined :) But it doesn't compile due to wrong pointer
types which is good (I run into this myself and looked confused at
first).
I didn't notice this at all because only kgdb uses this
CONFIG_CONSOLE_POLL which I had off. Once again, thank you.
