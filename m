My fault, but there's a bug here.  This long timeout is only needed
when the init-time timout is non-zero, so should be:

	if (uart->timeout)
		uart->timeout = (30 * HZ);

Without this, even though the default timeout is zero (meaning, UARTs
should not timeout and go idle), a timer will fire 30 seconds after boot
and cause the UARTs to go idle.

I discovered this when seeing the UARTs go idle, even though the
timeouts were all set to zero.

Can you fold this into your the next version?

Thanks,

Kevin
