Not a problem, thanks for providing the licence.

I think the two bootloaders make sense. Indeed, using U-Boot restricts
the size of the Kernel.
I also have the stm32429i-eval board, with 32MB NOR and 32MB SD-Ram.
At least on this one I will use U-Boot, as tftp could be used to load
Kernel since it has Ethernet port.

Yes, the Kernel always need to rely on the bootloader to provide a
minimal setup (clock/ddr/muxing...).
