A dmesg from v3.9-rc5 would be ideal, but sounds like it's a non-mainline 
kernel?

Are you using a serial console on that board, and if so, what UART is it 
on?

Are you seeing corruption caused by the OMAP UART's receive path, or by 
the transmit path?

When you say "only when PM is enabled" do you mean by enabling CONFIG_PM, 
or do you mean after setting an autosuspend timeout on the serial drivers, 
or something else?

So I'm using omap2plus_defconfig, which has CONFIG_PM=y, but the issues 
appear before serial autosuspend is enabled.

It wouldn't surprise me at all if something is wrong with the 
original driver's FIFO setup.  The challenge at this point is to keep 
the driver working while trying to fix what's wrong with it.
