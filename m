Actually PowerPC has a vaguely similar mechanism.

I think it is rather unlikely that we have to deal with multiple
instances in the future, it's more likely that future platforms
won't have any I/O ports at all, which is why I was advocating for
simplicity here.

I don't see a better alternative. I earlier suggested having these
out of line so we don't grow the object code too much when it is
enabled.

Performance of PIO accessors is not an issue here though, any bus
access will by definition be orders of magnitude slower than the
added branches and dereferences here.

Agreed, this looks wrong.
