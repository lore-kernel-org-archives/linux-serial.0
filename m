Right, I thought in a wrong way, in opposite it makes more sense now.

.dtsi

/* below the soc/ */
smb {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0 0 0x40200000 0x10000>,
		 <1 0 0xa0000000 0x10000>;
};

.dts

smb {
	ethernet@0,0 {
		compatible = "smsc,lan9220", "smsc,lan9115";
		reg = <0 0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <13>;
		interrupt-parent = <&nvic>;
		smsc,irq-active-high;
};


and looking again at .dtsi it seems to me that fpgaio should be moved
below the soc/ under separate bus interface which would hosts audio and
spi too or I keep missing things around device-tree?

I appreciate your help on this, thanks!
