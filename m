It was reported by Frans Klaver against am335x
 http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20140908183353.GB4686@ci00147.xsens-tech.local

and I managed to reproduce this with his yocto image on dra7 and am335x:

well it would enable pause of RX transfers. TX would not work (unless
TI's HW people can confirm that it will).

This is correct. If I remember correctly, the Intel people see the same
thing and I *think* John told me that the Intel manual says that RDI
should be disabled if DMA is used.

Yes, not doing XON/XOFF with DMA is not good. Using hardware flow
control is one workaround but the user has no chance of knowing that
XON/XOFF has been silently disabled.

You could send the x_char after TX transfer completed. After all you
need to ensure that you have some space in the TX-FIFO. However if you
send a 4KiB of data you might want to send x_char rather sooner than
later. I *think* even with pause the hardware will complete the last
burst before stopping but is probably better than waiting for the 4KiB
to complete.

Is this only the delay in omap_dma_callback() (which you don't have
!cyclic) or something else? omap_dma_issue_pending() seems to program
the transfer right away. Oh now I see the same thing in
edma_completion_handler(). Okay but this affects now everyone that
relies on low latency?

John switched to cylic mode so he was not effected very much non-pause
problem.

Most of them are hardware shortcomings. I think disabling RX-DMA due to
missing pause in omap-dma is the only workaround that could be avoided
if the driver would be changed.

I am not sure if the limitations are based on the DMA engine or the

This one for instance I don't see on BeagleBoard xM / omap36xx and
DRA7x. Both (not affected) use SDMA instead EDMA. It would be
interesting to see if DRA7x is affected once it uses EDMA.

true. But is this something that would work for others, too?

I think some registers are the baud-rate registers which pause engine.

as I wrote in my other email I think RDI should be disabled with DMA
according the Intel manual and I *think* someone here reported that
they see the same problem.

Am335x. Has edma and so has dm814x. According to the code, dm814x based
HW does not need it, can this be confirmed? Sekhar, TOny?

Is dra7 out? Because that one needs to enqueue RX transfers asap. And
omap36xx (aka BeagleBoard-xm) as well. I don't kown anything about
later SoCs (like am437x and so on) but I would assume so.
