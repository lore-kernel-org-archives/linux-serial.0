Not sure we're talking about the same thing here?

I mean the 100000 UART_IIR_NO_INTs that trigger irq disable, for which
John submitted a patch to ack these. I've never seen any discussion
regarding this problem on intel platforms.

An *extra* 6000+ interrupts/sec. for no purpose is bad.

Yeah, it doesn't need to be the very next byte but a better effort should
be made. 4k is lot of scroll-by.

Well, the real problem is that only one rx buffer is being used serially,
first filled by the dma h/w, then emptied by the driver, then resubmitted.
This creates a gap of time between the dma h/w completion interrupt and
the resubmission where data loss is possible (and happens).

In the omap8250 rx dma flow:

1. Submit 1st rx dma transaction
2. h/w finishes 1st rx dma transaction
3. * schedule completion handler * which may be delayed significant
   amount of time ( > 1ms )
4. data still arriving at uart
5. completion handler eventually runs but too late, so the
   2nd rx dma transaction is not submitted in time to prevent data
   loss.

This rx dma flow creates a hard deadline starting at step 3 and ending at
step 5 above that Linux won't meet.

The normal 8250 dma flow has a similar gap but it seems to be less
frequent, probably because of the disparity in rx buffer size
(4k vs. 48 bytes)

In the 8250 rx dma flow:

1. Receive rx interrupt, submit 1st rx dma transaction
2. h/w finishes 1st rx dma transaction
3. * schedule completion handler * which may be delayed significant
   amount of time ( > 1ms )
4. data still arriving at uart, more rx interrupts received but
   rx_running == T so no add'l transaction scheduled
5. completion handler eventually runs but too late, so the
   2nd rx dma transaction is not submitted in time to prevent data
   loss.

Instead, both platforms should use a ping-pong scheme (or more generally
a ring of buffers): initially submit multiple rx buffers which allows
the dmaengine driver to start immediately on next buffer instead of
waiting for resubmission. Not sure if this will work though, haven't
really experimented with it at all yet.

But that's why I'd like to bring the two implementations closer, so that
maybe both can be replaced with a single rx dma transaction flow.

  buffer copy ]

But the issue here is mainline, so it's still a problem.

Good point, I don't see why not.
Let's find out what the Intel guys think?
