Rubbish.  Let's say I hook an OMAP platform up to a GPS, and the system
integrator has decided to set the idle timeout on all UARTs to .5 sec.
The GPS transmits data every second.  Yes, it effectively retries each
second, but there's no way to receive its complete transmission _ever_.

So, if this is allowed, OMAP is broken.  Plain and simple.

And then they'll whinge that they get lost characters and abandon the
attempt.  Good, they learnt that the hardware is broken, and they
learnt why it's not implemented.
