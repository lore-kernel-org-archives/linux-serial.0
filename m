Consider to preserve style (upper vs. lower).

Something feels wrong with formatting here.

Interesting definition. Why not to set to 10 explicitly? And why 10?
(16 sounds better)

Doesn't miscdev parent contain exactly this one?

Redundant parens in one case. Check the rest similar places.

I would don't care about length and put it on one line.

Can it be opened non exclusively several times? If so, this needs to
be a ref counter instead.

Are all of them mandatory?

Perhaps devm_ variant.

Where is this used or supposed to be used?

> +#define JTAG_MAX_XFER_DATA_LEN 65535

Is this limitation from some spec?
Otherwise why not to allow 64K?

Perhaps you need to describe which of them are _really_ mandatory and
which are optional.
