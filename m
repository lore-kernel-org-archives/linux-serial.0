Just did a quick test on an OMAP4430 ES2 Pandaboard and the 
(OMAP2420-based) N800.  This series has no obvious effect on either N800 
or OMAP4430 Pandaboard, aside from the expected increase in interrupts in 
the non-CPUIdle case.  Probably this is due to the relative immaturity of 
the PM code on those two chip families.
