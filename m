On some ppc's we also use similar indirect access methods for IOs. We
have a generic infrastructure for re-routing some memory or IO regions
to hooks.

On POWER8, our PCIe doesn't do IO at all, but we have an LPC bus behind
firmware calls ;-) We use that infrastructure to plumb in the LPC bus.

Multi-instance with IO is tricky to do generically because archs already
have all sort of hacks to deal with the fact that inb/outb don't require
an explicit ioremap, so an IO resource can take all sort of shape depending
on the arch.

Overall it boils down to applying some kind of per-instance "offset" to
the IO port number though.
