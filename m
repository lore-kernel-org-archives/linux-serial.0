Who is the author of this patch?  The first version says Jon[1], v2 says
Deepak[2].  Either way, please ensure proper authorship is attributed
using From: at the beginning of the changelog.  (git-format-patch will
do this for you when the authorship is correct in the git history.)

Even better would be to summarize the changes since the first version
after the '---' so it would be clearer why the authorship was changed.

Only 1/3 of my comments from v3 were addressed in this version.  Please
re-read my comments there[3].
