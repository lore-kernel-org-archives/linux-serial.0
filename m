This is my complete queue fo the omap serial driver based on the 8250 core
code. I played with it on beagle bone, am335x-evm and dra7xx including DMA.
The runtime-pm pieces look now bug-compatible with the omap-serial driver.
Besides the runtime-om improvement I also fixed a few corner cases for the
TX-DMA problem. The DMA fixes (in edma and omap-dma) were dropped and the
problem has been in 8250-dma via patch #13.

The whole queue is available at
