Yes, that looks better. I would probably not list all the possible
values in the binding though, when the intention is to use the
hardware specific values, and being able to reuse the binding
and driver for variations of the same chip.

Is this bit always the same index as the one for the reset driver?

If this is just a divider, why not use a separate DT node for that,
like this:

        clock {
                compatible = "fixed-factor-clock";
                clocks = <&parentclk>;
                #clock-cells = <0>;
                clock-div = <8>;
                clock-mult = <1>;
        };

No need to assign a number for this.

Do these ones also come with resets?

How about #address-cells = <2>, so you can do

		resets = <&rcc 8 1>;
		clocks = <&rcc 8 1>;

with the first cell being an index for the block and the second cell the
bit number within that block.
