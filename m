Apologies for mangled mails... I am years over due ditching current method.

Yes slower baud + use of flow control should help. OMAP4 is like 10x better than OMAP2 with OMAP3 in middle.

Others would have to comment on this.  I never took this step as I was ok with degradation on debug console.

If ever I wanted better logs I tended to telnet/ssh in on a network port which was better at retry at higher level.
