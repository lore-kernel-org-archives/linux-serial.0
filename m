Sorry This seems to have slipped thru, wasn't intentional!

and here is the culprit. You have terminated the channel. This means th=
at
dmaengine driver is free to clean up all the allocated descriptors on t=
he
channels and do whatever it decides to do with them.

You have already terminated the channel so what is the point in queryin=
g the
status of the cookie, which you shouldn't use anyway after invoking
terminate_all() as its result is not correct.

Btw how does it matter in the driver here if the transaction completed =
or
not after terminate_all() was invoked. What is the purpose of querying
status.
