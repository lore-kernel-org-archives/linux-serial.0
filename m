Ok, got it.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Most architectures actually assume that those
two are the same, and nothing else has a
HW_SUPPORT_UNALIGNMENT_ACCESS option.

We do actually have a related problem on 32-bit ARM, where the current
generation of processors (ARMv6 and higher) support unaligned
accesses for almost all instructions with the exception of those
instructions that operate on multiple memory locations (ldm/stm
and ldrd/strd). We can control the use of those instructions in inline
assembler, and gcc never uses them when it knows that a pointer
is unaligned, but when CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
is set, the kernel sometimes intentionally contains code sequences
that lead the compiler to believe that a variable is aligned when it
is not, so we end up needing a trap handler here.

We might at some point want to clean this up by going through
all uses of CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
and changing them in a way that leads to better results on both
arm32 and nds32.
