Are you saying that with the new driver you have to respond to the RX
irq faster than before to avoid overflows?  It is not quite clear.

I do think 40000 interrupts to handle 40000 bytes of date does seem a
tad inefficient, so dropping to 854 looks a lot nicer.  Was the omap
driver not using the fifo trigger levels at all?
