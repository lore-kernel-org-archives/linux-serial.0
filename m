The API queries the capabilities for a channel. So a channel has been
allocated. BUT it would not imply the direction as that is descriptor based,
so should we query the capabilities for a descriptor and use those in
clients ?

Also the current dma_slave_caps() has been moved to framework and reports
based on driver callbacks.
Now we have a hardware which supports pause for one direction only so we
should model it bit differently

Thoughts... ??
