Aside from the missing Ack on the sparc patch, everything looks good to
get merged from my side this time.

I would suggest as next steps:

- ask Daniel to include the clocksource driver patches in his tree
- Provide a git tree with all the patches you plan to send for inclusion,
  based on v4.16-rc1.
- Add any further changes on top of that branch, without rebasing
  any further.
- give Stephen the git URL for inclusion in linux-next
