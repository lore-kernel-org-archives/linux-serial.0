Because it will generate tons of unnecessary reports when the patch that
WARNs inevitably ends up in mainline a version earlier than the patch that
fixes it.

I'm not sure to what you're referring here.

A WARNing fixes nothing.

If you mean some patch, as yet unwritten, that handles the dma cases when
dmaengine_pause() is unimplemented without data loss, ok, but please confirm
that's what you mean.

However, at some point one must look at the api and wonder if the separation
of concern has been drawn in the right place.
