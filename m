This bug only happens if we select large logbuffer (millions of 
characters). With smaller log buffer, there are messages "** X printk 
messages dropped", but there's no lockup.

The kernel apparently puts 2 million characters into a console log buffer, 
then takes some lock and than tries to write all of them to a slow serial 
line.

RHEL8-4.18, Debian-4.19, Upstream 5.0. I didn't try older versions.

Yes - this patch is present in the kernels that I tried.
