No one I know in TI has used or tested the RS485 functionality. Thats
why Sebastian left it when he created the 8250_omap driver. Since you
have the setup to test it, is it possible for you to migrate that
functionality to 8250_omap.c itself rather than enhance omap-serial.c?

We really want to be gravitating towards 8250_omap.c and this patch will
take us backwards. As a bonus you get more efficient interrupt handling
etc with the new driver.

Thanks,
Sekhar
