Thanks a lot.
There is a patch named "ARM: edma: unconditionally ack the error
interrupt". I have the feeling that this is not really required once we
delay set_termios. I couldn't reproduce the bug with beagleblack with my
usual test case.

For your "too much work for irq" problem: Could you add trace_printk()
in tx/rx dma start/complete, and irq routine? The interresting part is
what is the irq routine doing once entered. It might be a condition that
is ignored at first and "acked" later while serving another event. Or it
is really doing something and this is more or less "legal".
