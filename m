Using v9_pre1, I get a kernel panic in edma_dma_pause() on echan->edesc
being NULL. I do get data before this happens. This is at high speed,
high rate. No mention of the irq having too much to do, though. The more
data I transmit, the more likely this is to occur.

I don't currently have the setup to lower the baudrate. I would probably
need to reproduce this on a beaglebone, instead of our custom board.
I'll see if I can do that.

If you need more info, just let me know.

Thanks,
Frans
