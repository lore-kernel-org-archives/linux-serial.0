Sorry but having done this in the past the reverse is true. On ancient
machines with crap uarts the low_latency case would routinely overrun
while the non low_latency case did not. That was half of the point of
deferred processing - it pushed tty processing out of the IRQ handler so
bytes were not lost and a 486DX could cope with a 56Kbit modem.
