Well the nightmare userspace switch from ttyS to ttyO few years ago is
something we want to avoid.. I think the best solution would be to make
serial-omap.c transparently provide support for ttyO using the new 8250
code so both ttyS and ttyO devices would just work. Otherwise it will
be years of "my serial port stopped working" questions again.
