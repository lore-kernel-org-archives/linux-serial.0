We've been losing wakeup characters in mainline for many years now ;-)

Indeed, it seems that we are just now working around these wakeup-related 
bugs.  Kind of surprising that no errata showed up for them.

What's particularly remarkable is that it looks like the UARTs will 
idle-ack while their transmit FIFOs have data in them (!)
