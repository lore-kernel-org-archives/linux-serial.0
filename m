One difference I noticed between the omap driver and the 8250 driver is
the way modem status interrupts are handled.

The omap driver only checks modem status for the UART_IIR_MSI interrupt=
 type.
The 8250 driver checks modem status at every interrupt (other than NO_I=
NT).

I think the UART_MSR_DCTS bit always reflects that the CTS input has ch=
anged
between reads of the MSR _even if auto CTS is on_. So perhaps the hardw=
are
is being stopped by uart_handle_cts_change() when auto CTS is on?

[The UPF_HARD_FLOW thing was pretty much just done for omap even though
8250 already had auto CTS/auto RTS. Serial core hardware flow control s=
upport
needs a redo as drivers have pretty much tacked stuff on randomly.]
