Because if we are on the uplink end of a dumb protocol then our flow ends
up as

< 4K in
		read
rest of block
		read
		block complete
		write Y

until at some point sods law decrees that we do a big load of disk
writes, an SMM event steals the processor, firefox garbage collects or
somesuch and we go

4K in
		throttle
		flow control


It only has to happen *once*, not every time to screw stuff up.

No - because of the statistical corner cases. The standard Linux is not
remotely hard real time, and even if it were most of the tools involved
are not.

Even if there isn't the goal of low latency was always 'get stuff to
happen soon' not 'get stuff to happen in the IRQ handler' If you have the
tty processing happening immediately after the IRQ returns when
low_latency is set I'm sure the numbers will be just fine and as good as
historically.

Whether you can always do that I guess depends what happens on really
slow boxes if you don't do any deferral - eg on Geert's Amiga.

Flow control even in raw mode is expected Unix behaviour. However do we
ever need to evaluate it if the tty termios has IXON and CRTSCTS clear ?
