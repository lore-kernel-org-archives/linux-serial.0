Ah, right.  I forgot about that.  Please update the changelog (and
comment in the code) to reflect that.

So why not leave the driver out of it and solve it like the current cod=
e
does?

The current codes use the hwmod flags, then waits until the UART driver
is available (after omap_device_build) and uses omap_hwmod_idle() to do
an clean idle of the device.=20

Notably this is inside a console_lock/console_unlock block so that
prints are buffered.

The current code then does an omap_device_enable() to re-enable the
device, but you shouldn't need that after the driver is converted to
runtime PM.
