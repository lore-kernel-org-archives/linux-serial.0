Govindraj sent an RFC patch a few days ago to add IER2, which is good, but 
we're still awaiting the followup patch for it.

Yep, that's a good point.  Unfortunately the PER has a hardware sleep 
dependency with the CORE_L3 clockdomain on OMAP3... so I'm not sure how 
much power we'd be able to save.  Perhaps some: it appears that the UART3 
functional clock comes from the CORE_L4 clockdomain.  So it might be worth 
implementing some extra intelligence here.  The kernel code is disabling 
both the ICLK and the FCLK simultaneously, so that may not be optimal in 
this situation.

In the short-term, on the kernel side, we should just keep the PM runtime 
count non-zero when the UART is transmitting.  Since we can get an 
interrupt when the TX is done, or close to being done anyway, we can just 
disable the clocks at that point.  Not ideal, but should work.

Yeah.  I think we've got an acceptable workaround for the missing TX 
wakeup problem.  And we've got a somewhat unpleasant workaround for the 
missing RX timeout wakeup problem.   Now we just need to put together a 
strategy for the idle-during-TX problem...

Indeed.

Thanks for the info -- it's always nice to see your posts on the lists --
