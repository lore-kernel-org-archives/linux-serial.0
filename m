This workaround was not invented for sdma but for edma (with am335x).

This could be fixed. See
  http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg18517.html
  http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg18531.html

rmk was fine with it from what I read. So what is missing is just
refurbish the patch (update the comment according to rmk replay) and
then we could re-enable DMA again.
