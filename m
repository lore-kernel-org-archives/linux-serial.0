Ok, in that case, I would strongly recommend subtracting that 256
offset keeping the numbers the same, to remove the function-type
macros.

Are you sure that divider is actually part of the RCC?

We don't normally use register offsets in DT. The number 8 here instead
would indicate block 8, where each block is four bytes wide. Using the
same index here for reset and clock would also help readability.
