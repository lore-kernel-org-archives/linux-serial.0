It was meant as a logical extension to the existing interface,
translating the address as far as we can, and reporting back
how far we got.

Maybe we can return 'of_root' by instead of NULL to signify
that we have converted all the way to the root of the DT?
That would make it more consistent, but slightly more complicated
for the common case.

Yes, Zhichang also pointed out the same thing, this is not
right yet. My thought was that we need to check the #address-cells
and #size-cells of the parent node and return if they are not set,
but the bus should really have those.

What we need to do instead is check the "ranges" of the parent
and fail if there is no translation. Simply setting the host
here however won't work either because that leads to returning
OF_BAD_ADDR.

Right, this would work. The reason I didn't go down this route is
that I wanted to keep it generic enough to allow doing the same
for PCI host bridges with a nonlinear mapping of the I/O space.

There isn't really anything special about ISA here, other than the
fact that the one driver that needs it happens to be for ISA rather
than PCI.

If we do the special case for ISA as you suggest above, I would still want
to keep it in of_translate_ioport(), I think that's a useful change by
itself in my patch.
