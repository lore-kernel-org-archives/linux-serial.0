Not currently.  The question is more along the lines of: what is the
port_activity jiffies used for, and can it be replaced by using
_mark_last_busy().

If it cannot, that's fine, but it should be described.

OK, but AFAIK, DEBUG_LL + earlyprintk do not use this driver.  Instead
they use the debug macros, so any hacks to deal with that do not belong
in the driver.

If there are hacks required, they should be in a separate patch, with a
separate descriptive changelog.

The point was not just that the move was confusing, but that you change=
d
the functionality along with the move without any description.

Not sure what that has to with my comment.

In moving this code, you removed the enable/disable of IO ring wakeups.
It probably continues to work because they're enabled by the bootloader=
,
but that is not correct and the driver should be managing the IO ring
wakeups as before.

Any special consideration for features like no_console_suspend should b=
e
done in a separate patch with a separate changelog.

However, as I've stated before during previous reviews, if someone has
put no_console_suspend on the command line, that means they've
specifically stated they *want* to see console writes during suspend.
That means, we should not cut clocks at all.

Of course, that means the system will not hit the low power state becas=
e
the UART clocks are not gated, but that is what the user requested.
