Yes similar approach here, We are not doing hwmod idle
until console driver is available, once omap-serial is available
from probe doing hwmod_idle* and then get_sync.

hwmod idle in serial.c will still cause problems if ealryprintk tries t=
o print
until omap-uart console driver is not available, as now with rumtime ad=
aptation
only driver can enable back clocks. So have added a function pointer
to pdata which
calls hwmod_idle implemented in serial.c calling omap_hwmod_idle.

Thanks,

*function pointer implemented in serial.c not directly calling
omap_hmwod_idle API.
