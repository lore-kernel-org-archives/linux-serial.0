But first I would have to learn how to distinguish such upper layer misses 
from my own bugs ;). I'll try to do my best.

Actually I do not support two more possible I/O constellations: speaker only 
and microphone only. But I don't think anybody would find them really 
usefull. Even that Mixed configuration (Microphone+Earpiece) could be 
probably removed, I keep it only because it matches initail state, before the 
line discipline comes into action.

Thanks, I've already started with reading. There are several options AFAICS, 
I'll try to select the most suitable one.
As the code that requires locking belongs to the line discipline, I'll wait a 
little more for possible commemts from Alan or other serial guys, if any, 
before I try to implement any locking.

Thanks, will be rewriten this way.

Mark,
After all, I am not sure what your preferences finally are. If you still think 
that exporting gpio based jack state from ASoC framework over gpiolib sysfs 
doesn't hurt and can be usefull, I'll remove the code from my driver and 
provide a patch against sound/soc/soc-jack.c. But if you would rather prefere 
exposing jack state in a more general, not gpio limited way instead, or 
depend on input layer provided EVIOCGSW ioctl, as Dmitry suggested 
(unfortunatelly, unlike generic ldattach, there is no utility ready for 
use!), I'd rather keep this gpio_export() in my driver, let's say for 
diagnostic purposes, at least until that different option is ready for use in 
a convenient way.

Thanks,
Janusz
