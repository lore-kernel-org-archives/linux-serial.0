Hi Greg,

Please don't shoot the messenger :-)

In fact I was one of those who needed RS485 support in the OMAP serial
driver a couple of years ago and we were told that "software RS485 is
not mainlinable" [1].

I just wanted to warn Mark that he could be losing time pushing this
but I'm glad to learn that this seems not to be true anymore.
