No, the clue's there in the name - these are supposed to be for resourc=
e
management.  They only get called when the port is first acquired by th=
e
driver, and released when the port is no longer required (iow, they
cover the span in time where the driver is capable of using the device.=
)
They don't tell you about the lifetime that the user has the port open.

Well, we don't actually tell low level drivers that kind of detail (we
assume they're rather dumb - which maybe we shouldn't.)

It looks to me like there is the possibility of checking the TTY port
flags to see whether ASYNC_INITIALIZED is set - this will be clear in
->shutdown() method if the user is closing the port, otherwise it will
be set.  Same goes for the ->startup() method.

I'm not sure whether Alan would allow that kind of knowledge in low
level serial drivers though...
