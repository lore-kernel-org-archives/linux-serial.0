Would it be worth moving support out to somewhere more central so
others can use this "polynomial"?

Great.  So it looks like you should be using this, no?

  drivers/base/regmap/regmap-w1.c

I can see what it does on a coding level.

What are you using it for in practical/real terms?

Why wouldn't any other MFD driver require this, but you do?

You can set platform data later.  There are plenty of examples of
this in the MFD subsystem.  Statically define what you can, and add
the dynamic stuff later.

Does this go away if you use the already provided 1-wire API?

So it does serial things, but doesn't belong in the serial driver?

Could you please go into a bit more detail as to why you think that?

Why is it better here?

It's also totally unreadable by the way!

Please find other ways to save the space.  #ifery can get very messy,
very quickly and is almost always avoidable.

Please provide a MACRO, function or something else which results in
more readable code.  Whatever you choose to use, please add this text
above, it will be helpful for future readers.
