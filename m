Is 8250_omap serial console working for you on omap5 in general?

I've noticed that it's really unresponsive for me as if the FIFO
interrupt was not working. For example logging in might take several
attempts and a long time with each character showing up much later
after some timeout.

TX on the uart on omap5 seems to work OK, I do see all the console
messages fine. And these patches do not make the issue better or
worse.

Regards,

Tony
