Can you actually measure this? Your CPU would have to be extremely slow
if you could see the impact of an extra function call on interrupt
latency. From a maintenance perspective, this isn't very nice (it is
effectively code duplication).

I suggest you start with the simplest version of the code, and provide
an optimisation once you can measurably demonstrate that mask_ack is
better.

This feels wrong. Your interrupt controller doesn't seem to support the
trigger being changed, so irq_set_type would be a bit pointless. A
driver trying to set a level trigger on an edge interrupt would succeed,
and that is as bad as it gets. All you need is to expose the capability
of the HW when you register the flow handler instead of adding a rather
misleading callback.

Thanks,
