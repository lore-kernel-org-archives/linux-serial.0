Yes adding a _state_ local variable from port_shutdown from serial_core=
 layer
and passing the same to low level driver can inform the low level drive=
r.
whether current ops is shutdown or a suspend.

Also, looking into the struct uart_ops.

struct uart_ops {
=2E
=2E
        int             (*set_wake)(struct uart_port *, unsigned int st=
ate);
=2E
=2E
};

Unfortunately set wake is not being used in serial_core.c
So this uart ops can be used to enable wakeups
when port is opened and disable wakeups when port
is closed.

If set_wake is not supposed to be used in this manner I
will fall back to option1 to use state variable for shutdown ops.

tmp patch as in here[1] to use set_wake.
