is very likely especially with older OMAPs you can lose the 'wake' characte=
r on debug console. The UART operates on a derived clock from a 96MHz DPLL =
which was probably stopped. When the wakeup event hits the IO ring many int=
ernals may need to repower and its source DPLL needs to relock. This all ca=
n take a while and you can lose the start bit at high baud rate. If you use=
 flow control you might be able to get ahead of it.

So... if flow control is available, then when we idle the uart we should set
the trigger so that RTS is de-asserted as soon as one character arrives.
That would minimise the number of corrupt character we receive and ensure we
resync as early as possible (I have seen 2 corrupt characters when CR,NL
arrive back-to-back.  Neither get through correctly).

Actually ... could we make the off-mode setting of the RTS pin be "ready to
send", but as soon as we wake up, it is reset to "don't send now" until
everything is properly awake and configured?  That should ensure only one
byte is lost.


> Outside of debug console, this loss has not been huge. Protocols like ird=
a would retransmit their magic wake packets. You can move between DMA and i=
nterrupt modes with activity. So far there has been a work around per attac=
hed device.


What about bluetooth?  HCI/UART doesn't seem to have a lot of error
handling.  Maybe it has enough though.
(I have bluetooth on UART1 ... of course we might not have the same problems
on UART1 .. I haven't played with bluetooth much yet).

Thanks for the insights,

NeilBrown
