Thanks. I will fix it in the next version patch.

There is no cpu register to determine it. It also depeneds on page
size and way size however page size is configurable by software.
These codes are determined at compile time will be benefit to code
size and performance.
IMHO, I think it would be better to be determined here.

We use 1GB in our fpga platform, but I am not sure our customer's
config and their user space program may use bigger memory space.
Anyway, we will discuss it to decide the default value.
Thanks for your suggestion.
