I mentioned two different things here: ia64 IIRC uses some bits of the
port number to look up the domain, while powerpc traditionally had no
support for any such lookup, it did the same thing as ARM64 with
virtual remapping of MMIO ranges into an address range starting at
a fixed virtual address.

CONFIG_PPC_INDIRECT_PIO is a fairly recent addition, I was not thinking
of that.

Right, we clearly can't use it across all architectures. The trick with
architectures using ULONG_MAX as the limit for port numbers is that they
treat it as a 1:1 mapping between port numbers and virtual addresses,
which is yet another way to handle the MMIO-based devices, but that has
a number of downsides we don't need to get into now.

What I think the code should do is a generic workaround handling that
architectures can opt-in to. We'd start doing this on ARM64 only,
and can then decide whether to change ARM or PowerPC over to use
that as well.
