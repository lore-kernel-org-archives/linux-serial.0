Let's have a look - here is Pavel's version:
https://lwn.net/Articles/627201/

In pseudocode:

while(true) {
    cmd =3D get_cmd_from_firmware();
    if (!cmd) break;
    __hci_cmd_sync(cmd);
}

This is not "whole firmware at one __hci_cmd_sync step", is it?
And obviously that wouldn't work. Next let's have a look at
"It does not skip any packets":

/* Skip first two packets */
if (++num <=3D 2)
    continue;

Which are HCI_NOKIA_NEG_PKT and HCI_NOKIA_ALIVE_PKT. Those are
open-coded. By using the packets from the firmware we could drop the
negotiation/alive functions from the driver and remove quite a few
lines of code. I think it should only be done after finding the N900
bug, though. I found it quite useful, that first communication does not
happen through the firmware file.

Surely the radio packet is not ignored, but that part is not used on
N950 and N900 fails at first packet, so no way to test the radio
packet handling. I probably should add a /* TODO: check how to
handle radio packets */ for the radio packet entry. Or implement it
the way Marcel suggested and hope that it just works once the other
bug is found.
