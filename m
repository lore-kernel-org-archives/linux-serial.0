First of all, cpu I/O addresses is an x86-ism. ARM architectures and others
 have no separate address space for I/O, it is all merged into one unified
address space. So, on arm/arm64 for example, PCIBIOS_MIN_IO = 0 could mean
that we don't care about ISA I/O because the platform does not support having
an ISA bus (e.g.).

Exactly. Not fully compliant is a bit strong, as ISA is a legacy feature and
when it comes to PCI-e you are allowed to ignore it. Having PCIBIOS_MIN_IO != 0x1000
is a way to signal that you don't fully support ISA.

What I am suggesting is to leave PCIBIOS_MIN_IO alone which still reserves
space for ISA controller and add a PCIBIOS_MIN_DIRECT_IO that will reserve
space for your direct address I/O on top of PCIBIOS_MIN_IO.
