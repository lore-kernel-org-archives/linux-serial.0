Yeah let's not break things. The symlink solution won't work for kernel
console output so it needs to be dealt with some other way.

It seems that the biggest amount of work is making existing 8250
support the missing features in a clean way and without breaking
other platforms. Looks like 8250_dw.c has some pm_runtime_calls so
obviously it's doable.
