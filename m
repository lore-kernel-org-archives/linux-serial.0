Hello David,

   I have tried with 115200 also. Since it was not working I settled to 9600
.

   The Serial console was ttyS1. This is because this is the one with which
   I have done some data/text transfer through minicom sessions.
   Also I have checked the status change in FLAGS at /proc/tty/driver/serial
   when minicom is connected.

regards,
sudhir

Sudhir,

First a general comment: for ia64-specific questions, it's generally
better to ask on linux-ia64@vger.kernel.org.

As for your particular issue: the serial console normally is ttyS0,
not ttyS1, so that might be the reason you're not seeing any output.

Also, 9600 baud is rather slow.  If the client-side can handle it,
115200 baud will be much nicer.
