Well, all devices that we want to address are defined by firmware (via 
device tree or dsdt). So I'm not quite sure what this arbitrary limit 
buys us.

Well, it basically means that an arbitrary daemon running in user space 
that checks your temperature readings via the ipmi interface could 
create a lot of jitter. That could be very critical if you want to use 
this hardware for real time critical applications, such as telecom.

I bet that if you leave it like that and postpone the decision to fix it 
to "later", in 1 or 2 years you will cause someone weeks of debugging to 
track down why their voip gateway loses packets from time to time.

IIRC LPC (well, PIO) doesn't support bigger requests than 32bit. At 
least I can't think of an x86 instruction that would allow bigger 
transactions. So there's no need to make it 64bit. However, the question 
is why the prototype is 64bit then. Hm. :)

Maybe the prototype should be only 32bit.

Oh, I see. In that case -1 makes a lot of sense since it's the default 
read value on x86 for unallocated space.

This probably deserves a comment (and/or maybe a #define)
