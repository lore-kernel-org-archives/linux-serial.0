I am reworking on this patch with new patch this will not have below tw=
o snip
changes and will be removed.

+                       if (flags & OMAP_DEVICE_PAD_WAKEUP)
+                               val |=3D OMAP_WAKEUP_EN;
+

and

+                       val |=3D omap_mux_read(pad->partition,
+                                               pad->mux->reg_offset);

some more changes I have added for default rx serial pad as below
[this will be done in patch 6/7]

+       {
+               .name   =3D "uart1_rx.uart1_rx",
+               .flags  =3D OMAP_DEVICE_PAD_REMUX | OMAP_DEVICE_PAD_WAK=
EUP,
+               .enable =3D OMAP_PIN_INPUT_PULLUP | OMAP_MUX_MODE0,
+               .idle   =3D OMAP_WAKEUP_EN,
+       },
+};


So with this change it will enable io-pad wakeup once we disable
clocks based on
=2Eidle values and remux back to .enable values once we enable clocks b=
ack.
so io-pad wakeup for rx will be enabled only when I do put_sync.
[I verified this with lauterbach also]

I am not sure whether now we can control read/writes to pad_mux from an=
y driver
interface and I think we have to go through mux framework for any
read/writes to mux.
with this I cant control pad wake up capabilities with sysfs as done
earlier in serial.c
now control to read/write to pad is outside scope of the driver
interface as omap_hwmod_mux
is the one that takes decision for driver with mux values provided
during omap_hwmod_mux_init.
