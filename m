The real problem is the disconnect between serial console speed and
capacity in bits/sec and that of the regular console.  Serial, esp at
9600 baud is just a slow and limited resource which needs to be
handled differently than a graphical console.

I'm also big on ratelimiting messages, even critical warning
messages.  Too much redundant info doesn't help anyone.  And what a
subsystem thinks is critical, may not be critical to the system as a
whole.

In this case, if these checksum messages are telling us that there's
corruption, why isn't dm-integrity going readonly and making the block
device get the filesystem to also go readonly and to stop the damage
right away?

If it's just a warning for the niceness, then please rate limit them,
or summarize them in some more useful way.  Or even log them to
somewhere else than the console once the problem is noted.

John
