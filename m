tty->ops->write is the low level write method, not tty_write.

This appears to be even more wrong than the other one in other ways too -
it uses interruptible sleeps but doesn't handle the signal case so will
spin on a signal and kill the box.

NAK

Looking gat the traces I suspect what you've actually got is a much more
complicated deadlock where a process doing perfectly normal I/O to the
tty has faulted and there is a chain of dependancies through the file
system code to the thread which is doing the dquot_alloc_inode.

If that is the case then dquot_alloc_inode shouldn't be making blocking
calls to tty_write_message and probably the right thing to do is to queue
work for it so the tty_write_message is done asynchronously.

There are a very limited number of events that need reporting so probably
something like a per mount flags and workqueue would allow you to do

	set_bit(DQUOT_INODEOVER, &foo->events);
	schedule_work()

and the work queue can just xchg the events long for 0 and spew any
messages required.
