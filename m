I thought I had proposed a solution for this issue, which was this
sequence:

        omap_device_enable(dev);                                                
        pm_runtime_set_active(dev);                                             
        pm_runtime_enable(dev);                                                 

Yes, I can understand people not liking the omap_device_enable()
there, but I also notice that the email suggesting that never got a
reply either - not even a "I tried this and it doesn't work" or "it
does work".

As such, it seems this issue isn't making any progress as we had
already established that merely doing a "pm_runtime_set_active()"
before "pm_runtime_enable()" was going to break other platforms.
