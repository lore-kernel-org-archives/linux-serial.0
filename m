This change is needed for the UART DMA support if I'm not mistaken and =
this
mode is not really supported by older kernels, so having this to implem=
ent
something which is not going to be used in the stable kernels feels som=
ehow wrong.

The other loop is for handling the ERRATA i541 and the two loops can no=
t be
merged since the errata handling also require to change in SYSCONFIG re=
gister.

Yeah, I see that the errata handling is doing the same, fine by me.
