As it should.  If you don't increment the usage counter (for example, 
by calling pm_runtime_get instead of pm_request_resume) and you don't 
update last_busy then you are telling the PM core that the device 
currently isn't busy and it hasn't been in use since the last time it 
was suspended.  Under those circumstances, the PM core is _supposed_ to 
suspend the device right away.

Start by determining _why_ they don't call it.  Maybe they have a good 
reason.  If they don't then fix them.

In other words, you're suggesting we add a function that runs in 
process context and doesn't return until the device is fully resumed?  
That's exactly what pm_runtime_resume does right now.

Will that be acceptable in systems with shared IRQ lines?
