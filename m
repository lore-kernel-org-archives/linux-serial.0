Why is that assumption valid, and why does WRITE_ONCE help there? It's not
ONCE as in WARN_ONCE, more ONCE as in exactly-once-per-invocation.

You're already adding a Kconfig symbol for this stuff, so you can keep
that if you don't want it on other architectures. I'm just arguing that
plumbing drivers directly into arch code via arm64_set_extops is not
something I'm particularly fond of, especially when it looks like it
could be avoided with a small amount of effort.
