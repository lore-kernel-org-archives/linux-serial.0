Okay. We do have pause support in mainline for edma since v4.2-rc1.
This driver can use edma or sdma depending on the configuration. But it
is not yet released. So you suggest remove RX-DMA support completely
from the 8250-omap, mark it stable, and revert that patch once we have
it fixed in sdma?

The way this works is that it has to be fixed upstream before it can be
backported stable. Also Russell made clear (for a good reason) that the
RX problem has to be fixed upstream before he thinks about acking the
SDMA patch.
So if you prefer to instead remove RX-DMA until it is fixed, I am all
yours.
