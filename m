This is what I was referring to below as the difference between
a) and b): Setting PCIBIOS_MIN_IO=0 means you cannot have LPC
behind PCI, but it shouldn't stop you from having a separate
LPC bridge.

The easiest change compared to the v5 code would be to walk
a linked list of 'struct extio_ops' structures rather than
assuming there is only ever one of them. I think one of the
earlier versions actually did this.

Another option the IA64 approach mentioned in another subthread
today, looking up the operations based on an index from the
upper bits of the port number. If we do this, we probably
want to do that for all PIO access and replace the entire
virtual address remapping logic with that. I think Bjorn
in the past argued in favor of such an approach, while I
advocated the current scheme for simplicity based on how
every I/O space these days is just memory mapped (which now
turned out to be false, both on powerpc and arm64).
