There no mxs driver on mainline that has been DT aware of.  What I'm
going to do is to ask Arnd abandon the mxs/dt branch I sent him before
and send him an updated one with the whole mxs DT support based on
mxs common clk and pinctrl series.

The updated mxs/dt will have pinctrl defined in dts for each device
that is converted to DT.

If the platforms do not turn on CONFIG_PINCTRL, they are fine.  If they
turn on the support, they should provide pinctrl state either dummy or
real one.
