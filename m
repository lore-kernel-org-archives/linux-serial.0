Hehe.  Oh, hurt me again with more explanation, please ;-)  I can't take 
it ;-)  I happen to enjoy many of your technical explanations.  Doesn't 
necessarily mean that we're always in agreement, though.

As for the part about not wanting you involved with OMAP, that's an 
interesting perspective, considering I mentioned to you at ELC-E last year 
my appreciation of your technical review on the lists.  And you'll 
probably note, if you care to review the lists, that many of my E-mail 
responses express gratitude for your comments... including the one you 
quoted.

Of course the snarky, personal bits can be unnecessarily irritating, but 
anyone who's in this line of work just has to deal with them, it seems.

So if you want to believe otherwise, there's nothing I can do to control 
that.  But you should represent this as your personal perspective, and 
not as someone else's, e.g., mine.
