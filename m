OK good, so you are indeed keeping the clocks enabled, then.

Well, one shouldn't take the TRM too seriously.  But in this case, yes I 
think you had a slightly different idea than what the hardware people
intended ;-)

It's certainly possible that there is another idle bug in the UART where 
it could be mistakenly idle-acking when there are bytes left to be 
transmitted.  But the patch 'tty: serial: OMAP: block idle while the UART 
is transferring data in PIO mode' should fix that.  Are you running with 
those patches applied?  Also, are you using PIO or DMA?

I was under the impression you were referring to the behavior after your 
patch was applied, rather than before it.  My misunderstanding.

Sure, why not.  It's fast to try, and if it happens to work, it's better 
than hacking the driver..

Interesting.  A few questions.  Do you have the PMIC and the OMAP 
configured to scale voltage in retention?  Also, does the power effect 
differ if you use different autosuspend timeouts?

Hmmm yeah, that does seem weird that the MPU would stay out of a low power 
state just because the autosuspend timer was enabled.

Thanks for helping us clean up this driver :-)

By the way, you might want to cc Kevin Hilman on any serial patches too, 
since he has been working in this area also.
