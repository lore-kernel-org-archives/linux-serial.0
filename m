Hmm. This shouldn't happen because if dma->rx_running is set, then
there should be a descriptor to pause.
Could check how this could happen? (and which event tries to do so)

In the meantime, the lower part of [0] should fix the NULL bug.

I just pushed uart_v9_pre2 and I will post it once I rebased it on top
Greg's latest.
There was a bug where THRE could be active longer than needed caused a
few not needed interrupts until the FIFO was empty again.

My "less on file" test case did not fail anymore with this.
