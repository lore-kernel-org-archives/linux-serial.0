Sure if people prefer that.

Will fix.

Sure.

Hmm or we could just leave it out. I had it initially to test
things with the wake-up interrupt enabled during runtime also.

Yeah.. Let's just leave it out. You already mentioned it earlier and
there's no use for it.

The device driver can deal with the situation anyways in runtime resume.

And like you said, it must be IRQF_ONESHOT, now there's a chance of
consumer drivers passing other flags too.

The the IO wake-up interrupt vs dedicated wake-up interrupt functions
can be just something like:

int dev_pm_request_wake_irq(struct device *dev, int irq);
int dev_pm_request_wake_irq_managed(struct device *dev, int irq);

The life cycle of the request and free of the wake irq is not the
same as the life cycle of the device driver. For example, serial
drivers can request interrupts on startup and free them on shutdown.

Yes I think we can also automate that part, I've been playing with an
additional patch doing that for pm runtime. Been still thinking if
there's any need to manage that in the consomer driver, I guess not.

Right.

I believe that's already handled properly, but implemented in each
consumer driver with the if device_may_wakeup enabled_irq_wake.
