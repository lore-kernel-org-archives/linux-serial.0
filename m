Let me disable RX-DMA in 8250-omap code and push that stable. Then we
won't need a special annotation for pause support because it remains
off and is currently about one user. I browsed each driver in
drivers/dma each one which does support pause supports it and all of
them implement it unconditionally (ipu_idmac grabs a mutex first but
this is another story).
Adding error checking to 8250-omap like I have it in #1 and disabling
RX-DMA in case pause fails looks be reasonable since there is nothing
else that can be done I guess.
Once we have the missing piece in omap-dma the RX-DMA can be enabled in
8250-omap.
Does this sound like a plan we can agree on?
